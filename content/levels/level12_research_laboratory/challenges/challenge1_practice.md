# Literature Review Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Literature Review Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following literature review prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Research artificial intelligence."

2. "As a Research Librarian, conduct a comprehensive literature review on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating anxiety disorders in adolescents (ages 12-18) published in peer-reviewed journals between 2015-2025. The review should identify key theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches (including sample sizes and study designs), major findings categorized by anxiety disorder type, treatment delivery methods (in-person vs. digital), and significant research gaps. Synthesize the information thematically, evaluating the strength of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria, and discuss implications for clinical practice."

3. "Find some papers about climate change."

4. "As an Environmental Science Researcher, perform a systematic review of literature examining the relationship between urban green spaces and mental health outcomes. Focus on quantitative studies published in the last decade that measure specific psychological indicators. Include only peer-reviewed research with sample sizes over 100 participants. Analyze methodological approaches, measurement tools, confounding variables, and effect sizes. Organize findings by type of green space intervention and psychological outcome, identifying research gaps and methodological limitations. Synthesize implications for urban planning and public health policy."

5. "Tell me what researchers say about nutrition."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts have clear research focus definitions?
- Which prompts provide methodological framework guidance?
- Which prompts include synthesis and analysis direction?
- How would you improve the weaker prompts?

## Exercise 2: Research Focus Enhancement

Enhance the following basic literature review prompts by adding detailed research focus definitions:

1. "Review literature on renewable energy."
2. "Conduct a literature review on online learning."
3. "Examine research on antibiotic resistance."
4. "Review literature about social media effects."
5. "Analyze research on exercise benefits."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Review literature on diabetes treatment."
- Enhanced: "Review literature on non-pharmacological interventions for managing Type 2 diabetes in adults aged 40-65 with comorbid obesity, focusing on lifestyle modifications (dietary approaches, physical activity programs, and behavioral interventions) published in clinical journals between 2018-2025. The review should examine this topic through both medical and behavioral health perspectives, considering intervention effectiveness, adherence factors, and long-term maintenance of outcomes."

## Exercise 3: Methodological Framework Specification

For each of the following research topics, create a prompt that includes comprehensive methodological framework guidance:

1. The impact of microplastics on marine ecosystems
2. Effectiveness of diversity initiatives in corporate settings
3. Relationship between screen time and child development
4. Artificial intelligence applications in early disease detection
5. Impact of remote work on employee productivity and well-being

Your prompts should specify:
- Search strategy parameters
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Quality assessment approach
- Data extraction methodology
- Synthesis methodology

## Exercise 4: Synthesis and Analysis Direction

Create literature review prompts that include explicit synthesis and analysis direction for each of the following topics:

1. Vaccine hesitancy factors across different populations
2. Sustainable agriculture practices and food security
3. Digital interventions for chronic pain management
4. Impact of economic inequality on educational outcomes
5. Effectiveness of cybersecurity awareness training

For each prompt, include requirements for:
- Thematic organization approach
- Comparative analysis framework
- Critical evaluation criteria
- Theoretical integration methods
- Practical implications focus

## Exercise 5: Interdisciplinary Integration Guidance

For each of the following interdisciplinary topics, create a prompt that provides guidance on effectively integrating perspectives from multiple disciplines:

1. Climate change adaptation strategies
2. Artificial intelligence ethics and governance
3. Mind-body connections in health and disease
4. Technology impacts on social relationships
5. Sustainable urban development

Your prompts should specify:
- Disciplinary perspectives to include
- Theoretical bridging approaches
- Methodological integration strategies
- Terminology reconciliation
- Conflict resolution for contradictory findings

## Challenge Exercise: Comprehensive Literature Review Framework

Create a comprehensive literature review prompt framework that can be adapted for different research domains. Your framework should include sections for:

1. Research focus definition (topic, question, framework, boundaries)
2. Methodological framework (search, inclusion/exclusion, assessment)
3. Synthesis and analysis direction (organization, comparison, evaluation)
4. Interdisciplinary integration (perspectives, bridging, reconciliation)
5. Research gap identification and future directions
6. Practical implications and knowledge translation

Use your framework to create detailed prompts for:
1. A clinical healthcare intervention review
2. A technology impact assessment review
3. An environmental policy effectiveness review

For each prompt, explain how your framework ensures the literature review will be comprehensive, systematic, and valuable for advancing knowledge in the field.
