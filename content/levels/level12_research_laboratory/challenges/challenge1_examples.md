Your meta-review should include:

1. Systematic Identification Framework:
   - Develop explicit search criteria for identifying published systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   - Include both general (e.g., Cochrane Database) and specialized mental health databases
   - Document search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and quality assessment approach
   - Create a database of identified reviews with their key methodological characteristics

2. Methodological Analysis:
   - Categorize reviews by methodological approach (e.g., traditional meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, qualitative synthesis)
   - Analyze patterns in inclusion/exclusion criteria across reviews
   - Compare quality assessment tools used and how quality assessments influenced conclusions
   - Evaluate statistical approaches including heterogeneity assessment, publication bias handling, and effect size calculation
   - Assess how reviews address moderator and mediator variables

3. Comparative Outcome Analysis:
   - Analyze how different methodological decisions correlate with reported effect sizes
   - Identify patterns in which anxiety disorders show consistent vs. variable outcomes across reviews
   - Compare short-term versus long-term outcome reporting
   - Analyze how different comparison conditions (waitlist, placebo, other therapies) influence efficacy conclusions
   - Evaluate how comorbidity is addressed across reviews

4. Evolution of Review Methodology:
   - Trace methodological sophistication over time
   - Analyze adoption of reporting guidelines (e.g., PRISMA) and their impact on review quality
   - Identify methodological innovations and their influence on conclusions
   - Assess changes in how reviews address publication bias over time

5. Meta-Methodological Critique:
   - Develop quality criteria specifically for systematic reviews in psychotherapy research
   - Evaluate the degree of overlap in primary studies across reviews and its implications
   - Analyze how conflicting conclusions between reviews relate to methodological differences
   - Assess whether methodological quality has improved over time and its impact on conclusion validity
   - Identify best practices for future reviews based on methodological strengths and limitations

6. Research and Clinical Implications:
   - Synthesize methodologically robust conclusions about CBT efficacy
   - Identify which anxiety disorders have the most methodologically sound evidence
   - Develop recommendations for future primary studies based on methodological gaps
   - Create guidelines for clinicians on interpreting conflicting review evidence

The meta-review should be analytical rather than descriptive, focusing on patterns across reviews rather than summarizing individual reviews. Include visual representations of methodological trends and their relationship to conclusions.
```

- Specifies highly specialized role (senior research methodologist)
- Focuses on meta-level analysis of review methodologies
- Creates comprehensive analytical framework
- Requires sophisticated methodological critique
- Includes temporal analysis of methodological evolution
- Balances methodological focus with practical implications
- Addresses meta-methodological issues like study overlap

- Connects methodological decisions to outcome conclusions

### Example 6: Theoretical Framework Development Review

**Prompt:**
```
As a theoretical research scholar, conduct a comprehensive literature review to develop an integrative theoretical framework for understanding digital technology adoption and adaptation in educational contexts. The review should synthesize literature across educational technology, innovation diffusion theory, organizational change, learning sciences, and digital sociology from the past 15 years.

Your review should:

1. Theoretical Landscape Analysis:
   - Identify and analyze major theoretical frameworks currently used to explain technology adoption in education
   - Trace the intellectual lineage of these frameworks to their disciplinary origins
   - Evaluate the strengths, limitations, and boundary conditions of each framework
   - Analyze how different theoretical traditions conceptualize key constructs (e.g., adoption, resistance, adaptation)
   - Map areas of theoretical convergence, divergence, and complementarity

2. Methodological Paradigm Assessment:
   - Analyze how different theoretical frameworks align with methodological approaches
   - Evaluate the empirical evidence supporting different theoretical perspectives
   - Identify methodological limitations in testing and developing theories
   - Assess how theoretical frameworks have been operationalized in research designs
   - Analyze the relationship between theoretical orientation and research findings

3. Contextual Factors Analysis:
   - Synthesize how different theories account for multi-level influences (individual, classroom, institutional, cultural)
   - Analyze theoretical approaches to technology adoption across educational sectors (K-12, higher education, informal learning)
   - Evaluate how theories address cultural and socioeconomic contexts
   - Identify theoretical approaches to temporal dimensions of adoption and adaptation
   - Assess theoretical treatment of power dynamics and equity considerations

4. Integrative Framework Development:
   - Develop a comprehensive conceptual map of theoretical constructs across traditions
   - Create a multi-level, dynamic theoretical framework that integrates complementary elements
   - Resolve terminological and conceptual inconsistencies across theoretical traditions
   - Develop propositions that articulate relationships between key constructs
   - Identify boundary conditions and contextual contingencies for the integrative framework

5. Research Agenda Formation:
   - Identify theoretical gaps and underdeveloped constructs requiring further conceptualization
   - Develop specific research questions that would test and refine the integrative framework
   - Propose methodological approaches appropriate for investigating different aspects of the framework
   - Suggest longitudinal and cross-contextual research designs to validate the framework
   - Identify potential applications of the framework for educational practice and policy

The review should move beyond describing existing theories to critically analyzing their assumptions, evidence base, and explanatory power. The integrative framework should not simply combine existing theories but develop new theoretical insights that address limitations in current approaches. Include visual representations of both the theoretical landscape and your proposed integrative framework.

## Common Mistakes and Improvements

### Weak Prompt:
```
Do a literature review on climate change.
```

**Problems:**
- No specified role
- Extremely vague topic ("climate change")
- No guidance on scope or boundaries
- No methodological direction
- No content elements specified
- No organizational structure requested

### Improved Prompt:
```
As an environmental science researcher, conduct a systematic literature review on climate change adaptation strategies in coastal urban communities. Focus on peer-reviewed research from the past decade (2015-2025) that evaluates the effectiveness of different adaptation approaches.

The review should:
1. Categorize adaptation strategies (e.g., infrastructure-based, ecosystem-based, policy-driven, community-led)
2. Analyze methodological approaches used to evaluate effectiveness
3. Synthesize evidence regarding factors that influence successful implementation
4. Identify gaps in current research, particularly regarding equity considerations and long-term outcomes
5. Compare findings across different geographical regions and socioeconomic contexts

Use a systematic search strategy with clearly defined inclusion criteria. Organize the review thematically, with comparative analysis within each theme. Include a critical assessment of the strength of evidence for different adaptation approaches, and discuss implications for both policy and future research directions.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added specific role (environmental science researcher)
- Narrowed topic to specific aspect of climate change (adaptation in coastal urban communities)
- Added time boundary (past decade)
- Specified focus on effectiveness evaluation
- Created structured content requirements
- Added methodological guidance
- Required critical assessment of evidence
