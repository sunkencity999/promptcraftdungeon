# Research Design Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Research Design Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following research design prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Help me design a research study."

2. "Design a mixed-methods research study to investigate the impact of remote work policies on employee well-being and productivity in technology companies. The study should include: 1) A quantitative component with a longitudinal survey measuring well-being metrics, productivity indicators, and contextual factors across at least 3 time points, 2) A qualitative component with semi-structured interviews exploring employee experiences in depth, 3) Appropriate sampling strategy to ensure representation across job roles, seniority levels, and demographic factors, 4) Validated measurement instruments with justification for each, 5) Data analysis plan addressing both within-methods analysis and integration of findings across methods, and 6) Discussion of potential limitations and ethical considerations. The design should be rigorous enough for peer-reviewed publication while providing actionable insights for organizational policy."

3. "Create an experiment about learning."

4. "Design an experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of a new adaptive learning algorithm compared to traditional fixed-sequence instruction. The experiment should use: 1) A randomized controlled trial design with participants assigned to either the adaptive learning condition or the control condition, 2) A power analysis to determine appropriate sample size based on expected effect size from preliminary studies, 3) Clearly defined dependent variables including knowledge acquisition, skill transfer, learner engagement, and time efficiency, 4) Appropriate control for confounding variables such as prior knowledge, technology familiarity, and learning preferences, 5) A detailed protocol for implementation including instructor training and fidelity measures, and 6) Both quantitative assessments and qualitative feedback mechanisms. Include pre-registration procedures, planned statistical analyses, and considerations for generalizability across different subject domains."

5. "Plan a survey about customer satisfaction."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts clearly define the research questions and objectives?
- Which prompts specify methodological details and design considerations?
- Which prompts address sampling, measurement, and analysis plans?
- How do the detailed prompts guide more rigorous research designs?

## Exercise 2: Research Question Development

Enhance the following basic research prompts by developing specific, focused research questions and objectives:

1. "Study the effects of social media on teenagers."

2. "Research climate change adaptation strategies."

3. "Investigate consumer behavior in online shopping."

4. "Study the effectiveness of different teaching methods."

5. "Research the impact of exercise on mental health."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Study the relationship between sleep and academic performance."
- Enhanced: "Design a research study to investigate the relationship between sleep patterns and academic performance among undergraduate students, with the following specific research questions:
  1. To what extent do sleep duration and quality (measured through both wearable sleep trackers and validated sleep questionnaires) predict academic performance (measured by GPA, specific course grades, and standardized cognitive assessments)?
  2. How do different sleep patterns (e.g., consistent vs. irregular sleep schedules) moderate the relationship between sleep duration and academic outcomes?
  3. What role do potential mediating factors such as attention, information processing speed, and memory consolidation play in the relationship between sleep and academic performance?
  4. How do demographic factors, course load, employment status, and stress levels interact with sleep patterns to influence academic outcomes?
  
  The study should aim to not only establish correlational relationships but also explore potential causal mechanisms and contextual factors that influence the sleep-performance relationship, with the ultimate objective of developing evidence-based recommendations for university wellness programs."

## Exercise 3: Methodology Selection and Justification

For each of the following research topics, create a prompt that requests a specific methodology with detailed justification:

2. Methodological fit: Justify why grounded theory is more appropriate than other qualitative approaches (e.g., phenomenology, ethnography, case study) for developing a theoretical framework of first-generation student experiences that is grounded in their actual lived experiences rather than predetermined theoretical constructs.

3. Sampling justification: Provide a detailed theoretical sampling strategy that explains:
   - Initial purposive sampling criteria and rationale
   - Approach to theoretical sampling as concepts emerge
   - Sample size considerations based on theoretical saturation
   - Strategies for accessing diverse perspectives within the first-generation student population

4. Data collection justification: Explain the selection and sequencing of multiple data collection methods, such as:
   - In-depth interviews (with justification for semi-structured vs. unstructured approach)
   - Focus groups (with rationale for composition and facilitation approach)
   - Participant journals or diaries (with justification for structure and frequency)
   - Observation in relevant contexts (with rationale for settings and approach)

5. Analytical approach justification: Detail the specific grounded theory analytical procedures with rationale:
   - Initial, focused, and theoretical coding approaches
   - Constant comparative method implementation
   - Memo-writing strategies and purposes
   - Theory development and integration process

6. Methodological rigor: Explain specific strategies for ensuring trustworthiness and quality, including:
   - Researcher reflexivity practices and positionality considerations
   - Member checking approaches and limitations
   - Peer debriefing and external auditing processes
   - Negative case analysis procedures

The justification should demonstrate deep understanding of grounded theory methodology while addressing potential criticisms or limitations of the approach for this specific research context."

5. Documentation and Reporting:
   - CONSORT-compatible recruitment flow diagram
   - Detailed tracking system for recruitment and retention metrics
   - Approach to assessing and reporting potential sampling bias
