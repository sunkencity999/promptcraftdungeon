# Technical Documentation Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Technical Documentation Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following technical documentation prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Write documentation for my API."

2. "Create comprehensive API documentation for our payment processing REST API that will be used by external developers integrating with our platform. The documentation should include: 1) A high-level overview of the API's purpose and architecture, 2) Authentication and security requirements with examples, 3) Detailed endpoint references including HTTP methods, URL structures, request parameters, request/response examples in JSON format, and status codes, 4) Rate limiting and pagination information, 5) Common error scenarios and troubleshooting guidance, 6) SDK information for our supported languages (JavaScript, Python, PHP), and 7) A getting started guide with a simple integration example. Use clear, concise language appropriate for developers with varying experience levels, and include code snippets that can be easily copied and used."

3. "Document my Linux server setup."

4. "Create detailed system documentation for our production Linux environment that serves our e-commerce application. The documentation should include: 1) Server inventory with specifications, IPs, hostnames, and roles in a clear table format, 2) Network architecture diagram showing VLANs, security groups, and traffic flow, 3) Installed software with versions and configuration file locations, 4) Security measures including firewall rules, access controls, and certificate management, 5) Backup and disaster recovery procedures with step-by-step recovery instructions, 6) Monitoring setup with alert thresholds and response procedures, 7) Regular maintenance tasks with schedules and responsible teams, and 8) Troubleshooting guides for common failure scenarios. The documentation should be structured for both new team members needing orientation and experienced admins handling incidents, with clear sections, tables of contents, and cross-references."

5. "Help me write instructions for using our software."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts clearly define the documentation purpose and target audience?
- Which prompts specify the required sections and level of detail?
- Which prompts address formatting, style, and usability considerations?
- How do the detailed prompts guide more effective technical documentation?

## Exercise 2: Documentation Requirements Development

Enhance the following basic documentation prompts by adding specific requirements for content, structure, audience considerations, and usability features:

1. "Document our database schema."

2. "Write a user guide for our internal tool."

3. "Create documentation for our deployment process."

4. "Document our network infrastructure."

5. "Write a troubleshooting guide for our application."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Document our backup system."
- Enhanced: "Create comprehensive documentation for our enterprise backup system that serves both as a reference guide for the IT operations team and as a disaster recovery resource during emergencies. The documentation should include:

  1. System Architecture section:
     - Visual diagram of the backup infrastructure components
     - Detailed specifications of backup servers, storage systems, and network connections

     - Step-by-step recovery procedures for different scenarios (single file, database, full server, etc.)
     - Required credentials and access methods (with reference to secure credential storage)
     - Validation procedures to confirm successful recovery

  4. Troubleshooting section:
     - Common error messages with their interpretations and resolution steps
     - Diagnostic procedures for backup failures
     - Performance optimization guidance
     - Escalation procedures and contact information

  The documentation should use clear, concise language with consistent terminology, include a table of contents and index, feature abundant screenshots and examples, and be provided in both printable PDF format and searchable wiki format. All procedures should be written as numbered steps that can be followed during high-stress situations."

## Exercise 3: Audience-Tailored Documentation

For each of the following technical topics, create a prompt that requests documentation tailored to specific audiences:

1. Cloud infrastructure setup documentation for both DevOps engineers and financial stakeholders

2. Security protocol documentation for technical implementers and end users

3. API documentation for both internal developers and external partners

4. Database migration procedure documentation for DBAs and application developers

The documentation should include:

1. Conceptual Overview:
   - High-level data flow diagram showing the entire pipeline from sensor to analytics dashboard
   - Explanation of the domain-specific data concepts and terminology
   - Key design principles and architectural decisions with rationales
   - Business context explaining what questions the pipeline answers and why

2. Component Architecture:

   - Environment setup for local development and testing
   - Adding new data sources or sensors to the pipeline
   - Implementing new transformation rules or analytics
   - Testing methodology for pipeline changes
   - Deployment process for pipeline updates

The documentation should use progressive disclosure - starting with simple conceptual models and gradually introducing complexity. Use consistent color-coding across all diagrams to represent different types of components or data flows. Include real examples of data at each transformation stage. Create an interactive version where possible, allowing readers to "zoom in" on areas of interest. Supplement technical details with the "why" behind design decisions to build deeper understanding."
