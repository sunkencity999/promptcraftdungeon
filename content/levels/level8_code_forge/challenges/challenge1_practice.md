# Code Generation Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Code Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following code generation prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Write a Python function to sort a list."

2. "As a senior JavaScript developer, create a function that validates email addresses using regular expressions. The function should return true for valid emails and false for invalid ones. Include proper error handling and comments explaining the regex pattern."

3. "Make a program that does machine learning."

4. "Create a Python function called 'calculate_statistics' that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. Handle edge cases like empty lists or non-numeric inputs by raising appropriate exceptions with descriptive error messages. Include docstrings following PEP 257 conventions and type hints."

5. "Code a website login page."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts have clear functional specifications?
- Which prompts specify technical requirements?
- Which prompts include quality standards?
- How would you improve the weaker prompts?

## Exercise 2: Functional Specification Enhancement

Enhance the following basic code prompts by adding detailed functional specifications:

1. "Write a function to check if a number is prime."
2. "Create a program to manage a to-do list."
3. "Make a function that converts currencies."
4. "Code a password generator."
5. "Write a function to process text data."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Write a function to search an array."
- Enhanced: "Write a function named 'binarySearch' that implements the binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array of integers. The function should take two parameters: a sorted array of integers and a target integer value. It should return the index of the target if found, or -1 if the target is not in the array. The function should have O(log n) time complexity."

## Exercise 3: Technical Framework Specification

For each of the following code tasks, create a prompt that includes comprehensive technical framework specifications:

1. A function that fetches and processes data from an API
2. A class for managing user authentication
3. A utility for file operations
4. A data visualization component
5. A database interaction module

Your prompts should specify:
- Programming language and version
- Required libraries/frameworks
- Environment considerations
- Architecture constraints
- Interface requirements

## Exercise 4: Quality Standards Definition

Create code generation prompts that include explicit quality standards for each of the following scenarios:

1. A critical financial calculation function
2. A public API endpoint
3. A data processing pipeline
4. A user interface component
5. A system integration module

For each prompt, include requirements for:
- Error handling approach
- Documentation standards
- Testing considerations
- Performance expectations
- Security requirements

## Exercise 5: Edge Case and Constraint Specification

For each of the following code functions, create a prompt that thoroughly addresses edge cases and constraints:

1. A function that parses user input from a form
2. A date manipulation utility
3. A file upload handler
4. A text search algorithm
5. A payment processing function

Your prompts should specify:
- Input validation requirements
- Edge cases to handle
- Error scenarios and responses
- Performance constraints
- Security considerations

## Challenge Exercise: Comprehensive Code Generation Framework

Create a comprehensive code generation prompt framework that can be adapted for different programming tasks. Your framework should include sections for:

1. Functional specification (purpose, inputs, outputs, behavior)
2. Technical requirements (language, environment, dependencies)
3. Quality standards (documentation, error handling, testing)
4. Edge cases and constraints
5. Integration considerations
6. Performance requirements

Use your framework to create detailed prompts for:
1. A user authentication system
2. A data processing pipeline
3. A front-end UI component

For each prompt, explain how your framework ensures the generated code will be functional, maintainable, and robust.
