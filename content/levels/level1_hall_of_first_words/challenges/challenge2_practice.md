# Basic Command Structure Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Action-Target Clarity Analysis

Analyze the following prompts and identify which ones follow the clear [Action] [Target] structure and which ones don't:

1. "Open the door"
2. "Maybe try the lever?"
3. "The chest needs to be unlocked"
4. "Examine mysterious artifact"
5. "I wonder what's inside that cabinet"

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts clearly specify both the action and the target?
- Which prompts use vague or indirect language?
- How would you improve the unclear prompts?

## Exercise 2: Command Transformation

Transform these vague requests into clear [Action] [Target] commands:

1. "I'm curious about that painting on the wall"
2. "The room is too dark to see anything"
3. "There must be a way to cross this gap"
4. "This puzzle looks complicated"
5. "The door won't budge"

**Example transformation:**
- Vague: "I'm curious about that painting on the wall"
- Clear: "Examine painting"

## Exercise 3: Verb Precision

For each of the following scenarios, select the most precise verb to create an effective command:

1. You want to learn more details about an ancient scroll
   - Options: look, scan, examine, see

2. You want to move a heavy stone blocking a passage
   - Options: touch, move, push, adjust

3. You want to take a key from a table
   - Options: get, grab, take, acquire

4. You want to activate a magical crystal
   - Options: use, activate, touch, trigger

5. You want to combine two potion ingredients
   - Options: put, mix, combine, add

**Questions to consider:**
- Which verb most precisely describes the intended action?
- How does verb choice affect the specificity of the command?
- What potential misinterpretations could arise from less precise verbs?

## Exercise 4: Ambiguity Identification

Identify the ambiguity in these commands and rewrite them to be more specific:

1. "Move the statue"
2. "Use the key"
3. "Cut the rope"
4. "Check the wall"
5. "Turn the mechanism"

**Example:**
- Ambiguous: "Move the statue"
- Specific: "Push the statue toward the north wall"

## Exercise 5: Context-Based Commands

For each scenario, craft a clear, specific command using the [Action] [Target] structure:

1. You need to cross a river with a broken bridge
2. You discover a locked chest with no visible keyhole
3. You encounter a sleeping guard blocking your path
4. You find a room filled with identical levers
5. You see a message written in an unfamiliar language

**Example:**
- Scenario: You need to cross a river with a broken bridge
- Command: "Repair bridge" or "Find alternative crossing"

## Exercise 6: Command Sequence

Create a logical sequence of 3-5 clear commands to solve each of these challenges:

1. Lighting a torch in a dark cave to find a hidden passage
2. Retrieving a key from the bottom of a water-filled well
3. Opening a door that requires a specific sequence of lever pulls
4. Convincing a guardian to let you pass through a gate
5. Deciphering a coded message to reveal a secret location

**Example:**
- Challenge: Lighting a torch in a dark cave to find a hidden passage
  1. "Search backpack"
  2. "Take flint"
  3. "Light torch"
  4. "Examine cave walls"
