# Action-Target Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Command Structure Analysis

Analyze the following commands and identify which ones follow the proper Action-Target structure:

7. "Carefully and quietly"
8. "Open treasure chest"

**Questions to consider:**
- Which commands have both a clear Action and a clear Target?

5. "Help"

**Example improvement:**

- Improved: "Drink water" or "Pour water"

For each of the following Targets, provide at least two appropriate Action verbs that would make sense in an adventure context:

1. **Torch**: ____________ and ____________
2. **Map**: ____________ and ____________
3. **Rope**: ____________ and ____________
4. **Chest**: ____________ and ____________

## Exercise 4: Clarity Challenge

Each of the following prompts is unclear. Rewrite them using the Action-Target structure to make them clear and specific:

1. "Need to see in the dark cave"
2. "The locked door is preventing progress"
3. "Hungry after the long journey"
4. "The guard is blocking the path"

## Challenge Exercise: Multiple Target Sequencing

Sometimes you need to issue a series of commands to accomplish a goal. Create a sequence of 3-5 clear Action-Target commands that would help an adventurer:

1. Cross a dangerous river
2. Prepare a camp for the night
3. Negotiate with a merchant for supplies

Remember to keep each individual command clear and focused while ensuring the sequence logically leads to the overall goal.
