# Specificity in Action: Real-World Examples

## Example 1: Writing Task

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Write an article about renewable energy.
```

**Result:** A generic, broad overview of renewable energy that might not address your specific needs or interests.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Write a 750-word article about recent innovations in residential solar panel technology from 2020-2023. Focus on efficiency improvements, cost reductions, and integration with home battery systems. Include 3-4 specific product examples with their key features. The article should be informative and accessible to homeowners considering solar installation.
```

**Result:** A focused, detailed article that provides exactly the information you need, in the right format, for your intended audience.

## Example 2: Programming Help

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Help me with Python.
```

**Result:** Generic Python tips or tutorials that might not address your actual needs.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
I'm building a data analysis script in Python 3.9 that needs to process CSV files containing customer purchase history. I need help writing a function that can identify customers who have made purchases in three consecutive months. Here's my current code structure:

[code snippet]

The CSV has columns for customer_id, purchase_date, and amount. What's the most efficient way to implement this function?
```

**Result:** Targeted code solutions that directly address your specific programming challenge.

## Example 3: Creative Content

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Write a story about a hero.
```

**Result:** A generic hero narrative with standard plot elements.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Write a 500-word flash fiction story about an elderly lighthouse keeper who discovers something mysterious washed up on shore during a winter storm. The story should have a contemplative tone, be written in third-person limited perspective, and end with an ambiguous but thought-provoking final paragraph. Include sensory details about the cold, the sound of the waves, and the isolation of the setting.
```

**Result:** A unique, atmospheric story crafted to your exact specifications.

## Example 4: Business Context

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Help me write an email to a client.
```

**Result:** A generic business email template.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Help me draft a professional email to a client who has missed our last two project milestone deadlines. I need to express concern about the project timeline without damaging the relationship. We need their feedback on the design mockups within 3 business days to stay on schedule for the product launch. The client is a mid-sized retail company, and we've worked with them successfully on two previous projects. The tone should be firm but understanding, as their delay may be due to their ongoing store expansion.
```

**Result:** A carefully calibrated email that addresses the specific business situation while maintaining the client relationship.

## Example 5: Educational Content

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Explain quantum physics.
```

**Result:** A broad, possibly overwhelming explanation that might not match your knowledge level.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Explain the concept of quantum entanglement to a high school student with a basic understanding of physics. Use 2-3 simple analogies to illustrate the concept. Keep the explanation under 300 words and avoid complex mathematical formulas. End with a brief mention of 1-2 practical applications being researched today.
```

**Result:** An accessible explanation tailored to the right knowledge level, with helpful analogies and practical context.

## The Specificity Formula

When crafting specific prompts, consider including:

1. **Task clarity**: What exactly do you want the AI to do?
2. **Content parameters**: Length, format, style, tone
3. **Subject boundaries**: Specific aspects or time periods to focus on
4. **Audience consideration**: Who is the content for?
5. **Purpose**: Why you need this information/content
6. **Context**: Relevant background information
7. **Examples**: If applicable, examples of what you're looking for

Remember, the goal isn't to make prompts unnecessarily long, but to include the specific details that matter for your particular request.
