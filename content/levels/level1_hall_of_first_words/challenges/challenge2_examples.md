# Examples: Basic Command Structure

## Effective Action-Target Commands

The most effective prompts follow a clear structure of [Action] [Target], where:
- **Action**: A precise verb that clearly indicates what should be done
- **Target**: The specific object or entity that the action should be applied to

### Example 1: Operating a Lever

**Effective Command:**
```
Pull lever
```

This command is effective because:
- It uses a precise action verb ("pull") that is appropriate for a lever
- It clearly identifies the target object ("lever")
- It follows the simple [Action] [Target] structure
- It avoids unnecessary words or ambiguity

**Ineffective Alternatives:**
```
Maybe try the lever?
```
This is ineffective because it's phrased as a question and doesn't specify the action.

```
The lever looks like it could be moved
```
This describes the lever but doesn't actually command any action.

```
I would like to attempt to pull on the lever mechanism to see what happens
```
This is unnecessarily verbose and includes many words that dilute the core instruction.

### Example 2: Opening a Container

**Effective Command:**
```
Open chest
```

This command is effective because:
- It uses a precise action verb ("open") appropriate for a container
- It clearly identifies the target object ("chest")
- It follows the simple [Action] [Target] structure
- It communicates the intent directly and unambiguously

**Ineffective Alternatives:**
```
I wonder what's in the chest
```
This expresses curiosity but doesn't specify any action to take.

```
The chest needs to be opened
```
This states a fact rather than giving a command.

```
Try to see if the chest can be unlocked and then opened to reveal its contents
```
This is unnecessarily complex and includes multiple potential actions.

### Example 3: Examining an Object

**Effective Command:**
```
Examine scroll
```

This command is effective because:
- It uses a precise action verb ("examine") that indicates careful observation
- It clearly identifies the target object ("scroll")
- It follows the simple [Action] [Target] structure
- It is direct and unambiguous

**Ineffective Alternatives:**
```
Look
```
This provides an action but no target, making it ambiguous.

```
There's a scroll on the table
```
This merely states an observation without commanding any action.

```
I'd like to take a closer look at the scroll to see what's written on it
```
This includes unnecessary context and is overly verbose.

## Verb Selection Precision

Choosing the right verb is crucial for clear communication. Different verbs convey different intentions:

| General Verb | More Precise Alternatives | Best For |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Move | Push, Pull, Lift, Slide | Specifies direction or manner of movement |
| Look | Examine, Scan, Inspect, Read | Indicates level of detail in observation |
| Use | Activate, Insert, Apply, Operate | Clarifies how the object should be used |
| Get | Take, Grab, Collect, Retrieve | Indicates manner of acquisition |
| Make | Build, Craft, Construct, Assemble | Specifies the creation process |

### Example: Verb Precision in Action

**Scenario:** You need to learn what's written on an ancient tablet.

**Vague Command:**
```
Look at tablet
```

**Precise Command:**
```
Read tablet
```

The precise command clarifies that you want to understand the text, not just visually observe the tablet.

## Summary of Key Points

1. Use the [Action] [Target] structure for maximum clarity
2. Choose precise verbs that specifically convey your intended action
3. Identify the exact target of the action
4. Eliminate unnecessary words and context
5. Avoid phrasing commands as questions or observations
6. Be direct rather than tentative or overly polite

Remember: In prompt engineering, clarity and precision are more important than complexity or elaboration.
