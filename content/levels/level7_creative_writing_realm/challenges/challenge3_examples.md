# Worldbuilding Prompt Examples

## Basic Worldbuilding Prompts

### Example 1: Simple Setting Description

**Prompt:**
```
As a world builder, create a description of a coastal trading city with unique cultural practices, local geography, and economic activities. Format this as a brief encyclopedia entry.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (world builder)
- Specifies the setting type (coastal trading city)
- Requests specific elements (cultural practices, geography, economy)
- Requires a structured format (encyclopedia entry)

### Example 2: Setting with Historical Context

**Prompt:**
```
As a setting designer, develop a description of a frontier settlement on the edge of a mysterious forest. Include its founding history, current social structure, relationship with the environment, and ongoing challenges. Format as an informational guide for visitors, ensuring logical connections between the settlement's location and its cultural development.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies the role (setting designer)
- Defines the setting with context (frontier settlement, mysterious forest)
- Requests specific elements (history, social structure, environmental relationship)
- Includes dynamic element (ongoing challenges)
- Specifies format (informational guide)
- Adds consistency constraint (logical connections)

## Intermediate Worldbuilding Prompts

### Example 3: Multi-System Setting

**Prompt:**
```
As a world architect, create a detailed setting description for a society that developed in a resource-scarce desert environment. Include interconnected elements of:
1. Geography and climate (specific terrain features, weather patterns)
2. Resource management systems (water collection, food production)
3. Social structures that evolved in response to scarcity
4. Cultural values and practices reflecting environmental adaptation
5. Historical events that shaped their development
6. Current internal and external conflicts

Format as an encyclopedia entry with distinct sections for each element. Ensure internal consistency where geographical constraints logically influence cultural and technological development.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (world architect)
- Specifies the setting with built-in challenge (resource-scarce desert)
- Requests multiple interconnected systems
- Requires causal relationships (evolved in response, reflecting adaptation)
- Includes temporal elements (historical events, current conflicts)
- Provides detailed format requirements
- Adds specific consistency constraint

### Example 4: Culturally Complex Setting

**Prompt:**
```
As a cultural world builder, design a trading hub where three distinct civilizations intersect. Create a detailed description including:
1. The physical setting and why it became a nexus for trade
2. The three cultures with different values, governance, and technologies
3. How these cultures have influenced and borrowed from each other
4. Systems of exchange, translation, and conflict resolution
5. Unique hybrid practices that have emerged from cultural mixing
6. Tensions and alliances between different cultural groups

Format as a scholarly analysis with sections examining each aspect. Ensure logical consistency in how cultures interact and evolve while maintaining distinct identities.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (cultural world builder)
- Creates built-in complexity (three intersecting civilizations)
- Requests both distinct elements and their interactions
- Includes dynamic elements (influence, borrowing, hybrid practices)
- Requires both cooperation and conflict (exchange systems, tensions)
- Provides detailed format requirements
- Adds nuanced consistency constraint (interaction while maintaining identity)

## Advanced Worldbuilding Prompts

### Example 5: Systemic Constraint Worldbuilding

**Prompt:**
```
As a speculative world designer, create a detailed setting where electricity does not function but heat-based energy is enhanced. Develop this world by addressing:
1. The physical laws or phenomena that cause this constraint
2. Technological adaptations across different development stages (pre-industrial to advanced)
3. How this constraint shaped settlement patterns and architecture
4. Economic systems built around alternative energy sources
5. Cultural and religious interpretations of these physical laws
6. Geopolitical implications (resource conflicts, technological disparities)
7. Daily life adaptations for ordinary inhabitants

Format as an academic analysis with sections examining cascading effects across systems. Ensure rigorous internal consistency where each adaptation logically follows from the core constraint, with no convenient exceptions or workarounds that would undermine the premise.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (speculative world designer)
- Creates a fundamental constraint as the central premise
- Requires exploration of cascading effects across multiple systems
- Includes both macro (geopolitical) and micro (daily life) considerations
- Spans different time periods (development stages)
- Provides detailed format requirements
- Adds strict consistency constraint against undermining the premise

### Example 6: Evolutionary Worldbuilding

**Prompt:**
```
As an evolutionary world architect, create a setting that shows three distinct historical eras of the same society, separated by major transformative events. For each era, detail:
1. Dominant technologies and their limitations
2. Social hierarchies and power structures
3. Cultural values and how they shifted over time
4. Environmental conditions and human adaptations
5. The transformative crisis that ended the era

Then explain the causal threads connecting all three eras, showing how each crisis led to specific adaptations in the subsequent period. Format as a historical encyclopedia with timeline, era descriptions, and analysis of continuity. Ensure complete logical consistency where later developments clearly build upon (or deliberately reject) earlier foundations, with no historical elements appearing without precedent.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (evolutionary world architect)
- Requires temporal complexity (three distinct eras)
- Creates built-in dynamics (transformative events)
- Requests parallel elements across time periods
- Requires causal connections between eras
- Provides detailed format requirements
- Adds sophisticated consistency constraint (precedent for all elements)

## Common Mistakes and Improvements

### Weak Prompt:
```
Create a fantasy world.
```

**Problems:**
- No specified role
- Extremely vague setting type ("fantasy world")
- No required elements
- No format guidance
- No consistency requirements

### Improved Prompt:
```
As a world builder, create a detailed description of a fantasy realm where magic is a limited resource that must be harvested from specific locations. Include the geographical distribution of these magical sources, the social structures that evolved to control them, the technological and cultural adaptations developed around magic scarcity, and at least two competing philosophical approaches to magic use. Format as an encyclopedia entry with sections for geography, society, technology, and belief systems. Ensure internal consistency where access to magical resources logically influences political power, cultural development, and historical conflicts.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added specific role (world builder)
- Defined setting with built-in constraint (magic as limited resource)
- Added specific elements to include (geographical distribution, social structures, etc.)
- Required competing viewpoints (philosophical approaches)
- Specified format with clear sections
- Added consistency constraint with specific examples
