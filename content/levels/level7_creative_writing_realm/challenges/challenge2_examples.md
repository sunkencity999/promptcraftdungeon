# Character Development Prompt Examples

## Basic Character Prompts

### Example 1: Simple Character Profile

**Prompt:**
```
As a character designer, create a profile for a protagonist who is a middle-aged teacher facing a midlife crisis. Include their personality traits, background, and current goals. Format this as a structured profile with clear sections.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (character designer)
- Specifies the character type (middle-aged teacher)
- Requests specific elements (personality, background, goals)
- Requires a structured format with sections

### Example 2: Character with Internal Conflict

**Prompt:**
```
As a character architect, develop a character profile for a dedicated healthcare worker who struggles with burnout but can't bring themselves to quit due to a sense of duty. Include their personality traits, coping mechanisms, personal history that led to this career choice, and conflicting desires. Format as a structured profile, avoiding stereotypical "hero" traits.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies the role (character architect)
- Defines the character with built-in conflict (burnout vs. duty)
- Requests specific psychological elements (coping mechanisms, conflicting desires)
- Includes backstory element (history leading to career)
- Adds constraint against stereotyping
- Specifies format (structured profile)

## Intermediate Character Prompts

### Example 3: Multi-Dimensional Character

**Prompt:**
```
As a character developer, create a complex protagonist who is a successful corporate lawyer with a hidden past as a political activist. Design this character with conflicting values (ambition vs. idealism), a specific backstory involving a pivotal decision that led them to change paths, and current internal struggle about their life choices. Format as a detailed profile with sections for personality traits (including contradictions), formative experiences, current motivations, and relationships. Ensure the character avoids both corporate villain and righteous activist stereotypes.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (character developer)
- Creates built-in complexity (lawyer with activist past)
- Specifies internal conflicts (ambition vs. idealism)
- Requires backstory with specific elements (pivotal decision)
- Requests ongoing conflict (internal struggle)
- Provides detailed format requirements (sections for different aspects)
- Adds specific anti-stereotype constraints

### Example 4: Character with Psychological Depth

**Prompt:**
```
As a psychological character architect, develop a character who presents as confident and charismatic to others but struggles with impostor syndrome privately. Create a detailed profile including: conscious motivations (recognition, validation) versus unconscious drives (fear of abandonment), defense mechanisms used in different contexts, cognitive patterns (how they process criticism), and a specific childhood experience that shaped their self-perception. Format with clearly labeled sections for external presentation, internal reality, psychological mechanisms, backstory, and relationships. Avoid simplistic psychology or easy resolutions to their internal conflicts.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (psychological character architect)
- Creates contrast between external/internal (confident outside, impostor syndrome inside)
- Distinguishes between conscious/unconscious elements
- Requests specific psychological components (defense mechanisms, cognitive patterns)
- Requires formative backstory element
- Provides detailed format requirements
- Adds constraint against oversimplification

## Advanced Character Prompts

### Example 5: Character Defined Through Relationships

**Prompt:**
```
As a character relationship specialist, create a protagonist defined primarily through their dynamic connections to others. Develop a character profile for someone who serves as a community mediator but struggles to apply the same skills in their personal life. Structure the profile as a relationship matrix showing how the character:
1. Presents differently to different people (colleagues, family, strangers)
2. Has evolved through 3 key relationships (mentor, rival, dependent)
3. Experiences internal contradictions based on these relationships
4. Navigates conflicting expectations from different social circles

Include a core psychological truth that explains these variations and a specific backstory element that created this relational pattern. Format with sections for each relationship type, behavioral patterns, internal experience, and history. Avoid creating a people-pleaser stereotype or someone without a distinct personality.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (character relationship specialist)
- Defines character through relationships rather than traits
- Creates built-in contradiction (mediator professionally but not personally)
- Requires multiple perspectives (how they present to different people)
- Specifies developmental elements (evolution through relationships)
- Requests unifying psychological element
- Provides detailed structure
- Adds specific anti-stereotype constraints

### Example 6: Character Arc Design

**Prompt:**
```
As a character arc designer, create a detailed profile for a protagonist who will undergo a transformation from self-deception to radical honesty. Develop this character with:
1. Initial state: Specific beliefs, behaviors and defense mechanisms that maintain their self-deception
2. Vulnerability points: Psychological triggers that could catalyze change
3. Resistance factors: Internal and external forces that will fight transformation
4. Transformation sequence: A 4-stage progression showing how they might realistically change
5. End state: A changed but still complex character with new challenges

Format as a developmental profile with distinct sections for each stage, including personality traits, behavioral patterns, and internal monologue examples for each phase. Include a specific backstory that explains the origin of their self-deception. Avoid both overly simplistic redemption arcs and cynical impossibility of change.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (character arc designer)
- Focuses on transformation rather than static traits
- Requires specific starting and ending states
- Includes obstacles and catalysts for change
- Requests realistic progression in stages
- Provides detailed format requirements
- Ensures complexity in the transformed state
- Adds constraints against common arc problems

## Common Mistakes and Improvements

### Weak Prompt:
```
Create a character who is a detective.
```

**Problems:**
- No specified role
- Vague character type (just "detective")
- No psychological or backstory requirements
- No format guidance
- No complexity or depth parameters

### Improved Prompt:
```
As a character developer, create a detailed profile for a detective character with conflicting traits: exceptional observational skills but significant emotional blindspots. Include their investigative methodology, psychological defense mechanisms, a formative experience that drew them to detective work, and their complex relationship with authority. Format as a structured profile with sections for professional approach, personal psychology, backstory, and relationships. Ensure the character avoids common detective stereotypes (alcoholic, lone wolf, etc.) while maintaining believable flaws.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added specific role (character developer)
- Defined character with built-in contradictions (observational skills vs. emotional blindspots)
- Added specific elements to include (methodology, defense mechanisms, etc.)
- Required formative backstory element
- Specified format with clear sections
- Added anti-stereotype constraint with nuance (avoid stereotypes but maintain flaws)
