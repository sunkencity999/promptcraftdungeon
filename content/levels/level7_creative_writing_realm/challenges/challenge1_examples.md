# Storytelling Prompt Examples

## Basic Narrative Prompts

### Example 1: Simple Story Structure

**Prompt:**
```
As a storyteller, write a short story about a lost child finding their way home, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, written in third-person perspective.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (storyteller)
- Specifies a clear subject (lost child finding way home)
- Requests specific structure (beginning, middle, end)
- Sets the narrative perspective (third-person)

### Example 2: Character-Focused Narrative

**Prompt:**
```
As a character developer, create a story about a cynical detective who undergoes a transformation after meeting someone from their past. Include a clear character arc from distrust to vulnerability, written in third-person limited perspective.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies the role (character developer)
- Defines the protagonist (cynical detective)
- Requires specific character development (transformation)
- Specifies the arc direction (distrust to vulnerability)
- Sets narrative perspective (third-person limited)

## Intermediate Narrative Prompts

### Example 3: Genre-Specific Storytelling

**Prompt:**
```
As a science fiction author, write a story set on a space station where a maintenance worker discovers an anomaly in the ship's systems. Structure the narrative with rising tension, a climactic revelation, and a resolution that changes the protagonist's understanding of reality. Use third-person perspective and incorporate themes of isolation and trust.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies genre and role (science fiction author)
- Establishes setting (space station)
- Defines protagonist and inciting incident (maintenance worker, anomaly)
- Requires specific narrative structure (rising tension, climax, resolution)
- Includes character change element (changes understanding)
- Specifies perspective (third-person)
- Adds thematic requirements (isolation, trust)

### Example 4: Emotional Journey Narrative

**Prompt:**
```
As a narrative designer, create a story about grief and acceptance following a personal loss. Structure the narrative in three distinct phases: denial, confrontation, and integration. Include a supporting character who serves as a catalyst for the protagonist's emotional journey. Write in third-person intimate perspective, focusing on sensory details that reflect the protagonist's emotional state.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (narrative designer)
- Specifies the emotional themes (grief, acceptance)
- Requires specific three-part structure (denial, confrontation, integration)
- Includes character dynamics (supporting character as catalyst)
- Specifies perspective with stylistic guidance (third-person intimate, sensory details)
- Links style to content (sensory details reflecting emotions)

## Advanced Narrative Prompts

### Example 5: Complex Structural Narrative

**Prompt:**
```
As a postmodern storyteller, create a non-linear narrative about three strangers whose lives intersect through a shared object. Structure the story as a triptych where each section focuses on a different character but reveals new information about the previous sections. Each character should undergo a different type of transformation (moral, intellectual, emotional). Write in third-person omniscient perspective, using distinct voice patterns for each character's sections.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies sophisticated role (postmodern storyteller)
- Requires complex structure (non-linear, triptych)
- Defines character relationships (three strangers, intersecting lives)
- Specifies the connecting element (shared object)
- Requires narrative technique (revelations about previous sections)
- Differentiates character arcs (different types of transformation)
- Specifies perspective with advanced technique (omniscient with distinct voice patterns)

### Example 6: Constraint-Based Narrative

**Prompt:**
```
As an experimental fiction writer, create a story told entirely through five objects found in an abandoned house. Each object should reveal part of a narrative about the former inhabitants and hint at why they left. Structure the narrative to gradually increase tension, with the final object providing a revelation that recontextualizes all previous objects. The narrative should transform the reader's understanding from mundane to unsettling. Use third-person objective perspective, never directly describing characters but only their traces.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies experimental role (experimental fiction writer)
- Imposes creative constraint (told through five objects)
- Defines setting and mystery (abandoned house, why inhabitants left)
- Requires specific structure (gradually increasing tension)
- Includes twist element (final revelation recontextualizes)
- Specifies reader experience transformation (mundane to unsettling)
- Uses advanced perspective technique (objective, only traces of characters)

## Common Mistakes and Improvements

### Weak Prompt:
```
Write a story about a hero.
```

**Problems:**
- No specified role
- Vague subject ("a hero")
- No structural guidance
- No perspective requirements
- No character development parameters

### Improved Prompt:
```
As a fantasy storyteller, write a short story about a reluctant hero who must make a difficult choice when confronted with their destiny. Structure the narrative with an inciting incident, a moment of refusal, and a climactic decision. The protagonist should transform from fearful to courageous through the story. Write in third-person limited perspective, focusing on the protagonist's internal conflict.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added specific role (fantasy storyteller)
- Defined character type and situation (reluctant hero, difficult choice)
- Added structural requirements (inciting incident, refusal, decision)
- Specified character transformation (fearful to courageous)
- Added perspective requirement (third-person limited)
- Included focus element (internal conflict)
