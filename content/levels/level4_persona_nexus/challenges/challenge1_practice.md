# Persona-Based Prompting Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Persona Analysis

Analyze the following persona-based prompts and identify what makes them effective or ineffective:

1. "As a master chef with 20 years of experience in French cuisine, explain how to properly make a roux for thickening sauces."
2. "As someone who knows about cars, what's wrong with my engine?"
3. "As a pediatrician who specializes in developmental milestones, explain the typical language development stages for children ages 1-3 years."
4. "As a smart person, solve this math problem."
5. "As a cybersecurity expert with experience in threat detection systems, analyze these unusual network traffic patterns and identify potential security concerns."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which personas are well-defined and which are vague?
- What specific expertise or qualifications strengthen certain personas?
- How does the specificity of the persona affect the potential quality of the response?
- How could you improve the weaker persona prompts?

## Exercise 2: Persona Selection

For each of the following scenarios, identify the most appropriate persona(s) that would provide the best response:

1. You need advice on optimizing a small business website for search engines.
2. You want to understand the historical context of a 17th-century poem.
3. You need help troubleshooting a complex programming bug.
4. You want guidance on creating an effective workout routine for building strength.
5. You need to understand complex legal terminology in a contract.

For each scenario, create a well-defined persona prompt that includes relevant expertise, experience, and specialization.

## Exercise 3: Persona Refinement

Take the following basic personas and enhance them with specific details that would make them more effective:

1. "As a doctor..."
2. "As a teacher..."
3. "As a financial advisor..."
4. "As a writer..."
5. "As an engineer..."

**Example refinement:**
- Basic: "As a scientist..."
- Enhanced: "As a molecular biologist specializing in CRISPR gene editing technology with 15 years of research experience at leading genomics laboratories..."

## Exercise 4: Multi-Dimensional Personas

Create complex, multi-dimensional personas for each of the following scenarios that include multiple relevant aspects of expertise:

1. You need guidance on creating a historically accurate yet engaging educational game about ancient Egypt.
2. You want advice on designing an eco-friendly garden that attracts local wildlife while remaining low-maintenance.
3. You need help developing a marketing strategy for a new health-focused food product.
4. You want assistance creating accessible technology tutorials for seniors.
5. You need advice on implementing a corporate wellness program that improves both physical health and mental wellbeing.

## Exercise 5: Persona for Perspective Shifting

For each of the following topics, create prompts using different personas that would provide contrasting perspectives:

1. **Topic: The impact of artificial intelligence on employment**
   - Persona 1: _______________________
   - Persona 2: _______________________
   - Persona 3: _______________________

2. **Topic: The future of urban transportation**
   - Persona 1: _______________________
   - Persona 2: _______________________
   - Persona 3: _______________________

3. **Topic: The role of standardized testing in education**
   - Persona 1: _______________________
   - Persona 2: _______________________
   - Persona 3: _______________________

For each set of personas, explain what unique perspective each would bring to the topic.

## Challenge Exercise: Persona Combination and Collaboration

Sometimes complex problems benefit from multiple perspectives working together. For each of the following scenarios, create a prompt that establishes a "team" of 2-3 distinct personas collaborating on the problem:

1. Designing a new public space in a diverse urban neighborhood
2. Developing a comprehensive approach to climate change adaptation
3. Creating an innovative educational curriculum for middle school students
4. Addressing a complex ethical dilemma in healthcare
5. Planning a major corporate digital transformation initiative

For each prompt, clearly define each persona on the "team," their specific area of expertise, and how they should collaborate to address the challenge. Structure your prompt to ensure each persona contributes their unique perspective while working toward an integrated solution.
