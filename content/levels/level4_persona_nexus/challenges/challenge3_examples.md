## The Combination Framework

When combining personas and formats in your prompts, consider these guiding principles:

1. **Persona-Format Alignment**
   - Choose personas who would naturally use the specified format
   - Match format complexity to the persona's expertise level
   - Consider domain-specific formats that professionals in that field actually use

2. **User-Centered Design**
   - Select the combination based on how the information will be used
   - Consider the end user's familiarity with both the subject matter and format
   - Prioritize clarity and usability over complexity

3. **Purpose Optimization**
   - Decision-making → Expert persona + comparison format
   - Learning → Educator persona + structured educational format
   - Implementation → Practitioner persona + step-by-step format
   - Analysis → Analyst persona + analytical framework format

4. **Balance and Integration**
   - Ensure the format allows the persona's expertise to shine
   - Don't let complex format requirements overshadow content quality
   - Consider how the persona would naturally adapt the format to best convey their expertise

Remember, the most powerful combinations don't just stack techniques—they integrate them in ways where each enhances the other, resulting in responses that are both expertly informed and optimally structured for your specific needs.
