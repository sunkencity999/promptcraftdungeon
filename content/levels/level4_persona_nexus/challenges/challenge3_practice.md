# Persona and Perspective Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Persona Identification

Analyze the following prompts and identify which ones effectively use persona or perspective constraints:

1. "Explain quantum computing."

2. "As a quantum physicist with experience teaching complex concepts to undergraduate students, explain quantum computing in a way that balances technical accuracy with accessibility. Focus on the practical implications rather than mathematical formulations."

3. "Give me ideas for reducing plastic waste."

4. "From the perspective of an environmental sustainability expert specializing in circular economy principles, provide strategic approaches for reducing plastic waste in corporate supply chains, with particular attention to implementation challenges and measurement frameworks."

5. "Write a review of the latest iPhone."

**Questions to consider:**
- How does the specified persona influence the expected response?
- What expertise, values, or viewpoints are implied by the persona?
- How might the same question yield different answers with different personas?

## Exercise 2: Persona Selection

For each of the following topics, identify three different personas that would provide valuable but distinct perspectives, and create a prompt for each:

1. Climate change solutions

2. Educational reform

3. Urban planning

4. Healthcare innovation

5. Artificial intelligence ethics

**Example for climate change:**
- Scientific perspective: "As a climate scientist with expertise in atmospheric modeling, explain the most promising technological interventions for reducing global carbon emissions, focusing on efficacy, scalability, and implementation timeframes."
- Economic perspective: "From the perspective of an environmental economist specializing in market-based solutions, analyze the most cost-effective approaches to climate change mitigation, considering both direct costs and externalities."
- Policy perspective: "In the role of a climate policy advisor with experience in international negotiations, outline the key components of an effective global climate agreement that balances the needs of developed and developing nations while ensuring meaningful emissions reductions."

## Exercise 3: Perspective Contrast

For each of the following controversial topics, create prompts requesting analysis from opposing perspectives:

1. Universal basic income

2. Nuclear energy

3. Standardized testing in education

4. Social media regulation

5. Artificial intelligence development

For each topic, create a prompt for two contrasting perspectives, and then a third prompt requesting a balanced analysis that considers multiple viewpoints.

**Example:**
- Perspective 1: "As an advocate for digital privacy rights, analyze the implications of comprehensive social media regulation, highlighting the benefits for individual privacy and potential harms from unregulated data collection."
- Perspective 2: "From the perspective of a tech industry innovation expert, examine the potential drawbacks of strict social media regulation, focusing on impacts to innovation, competition, and economic growth."
- Balanced perspective: "In the role of a policy analyst tasked with providing objective guidance to legislators, present a balanced analysis of social media regulation approaches that considers privacy protections, innovation impacts, competition effects, and practical implementation challenges."

## Exercise 4: Specialized Expertise Personas

Create prompts that specify highly specialized expertise personas for the following scenarios:

1. Analyzing a complex legal case

2. Designing an educational curriculum

3. Evaluating an investment opportunity

4. Developing a public health campaign

5. Critiquing a creative work

**Example:**
"In the role of a pediatric nutritionist specializing in feeding disorders and sensory processing issues, with experience in both clinical and school settings, evaluate this proposed elementary school lunch program. Consider nutritional adequacy, sensory variety, potential allergen management, implementation feasibility, and specific accommodations for children with various feeding challenges."

## Exercise 5: Multi-Dimensional Personas

Create prompts with complex, multi-dimensional personas that combine different types of expertise, experiences, or viewpoints for the following topics:

1. Work-life balance strategies

2. Cross-cultural communication

3. Sustainable urban development

4. Technology in education

5. Mental health support systems

**Example:**
"Analyze approaches to work-life balance from the perspective of someone who is simultaneously: 1) an organizational psychologist specializing in workplace wellbeing, 2) a former corporate executive who experienced burnout, and 3) a parent who transitioned from full-time to flexible work arrangements. Consider both evidence-based best practices and practical implementation challenges across different career stages and industry contexts."

## Exercise 6: Persona for Different Purposes

Create persona-based prompts for the same basic request (analyzing a business strategy) tailored for different purposes:

1. For identifying potential risks and weaknesses

2. For highlighting innovative opportunities

3. For evaluating financial viability

4. For assessing competitive positioning

5. For examining ethical implications

For each purpose, specify an appropriate persona that would bring valuable expertise or perspective to that specific aspect of the analysis.

**Example:**
"In the role of a risk management consultant with experience helping companies navigate market downturns and supply chain disruptions, analyze the proposed business strategy with a focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities, blind spots, and contingency gaps. Pay particular attention to assumptions that may not hold under adverse conditions and provide a framework for strengthening the strategy's resilience."
