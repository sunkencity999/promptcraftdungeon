# Constraints in Action: Real-World Examples

## Example 1: Technical Writing with Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Explain how blockchain technology works.
```

**Result:** A potentially complex, technical explanation that might overwhelm non-technical readers.

**Constrained Prompt:**
```
Explain how blockchain technology works with these constraints:
- Do not use technical jargon without immediately explaining it in simple terms
- Avoid mathematical explanations or formulas
- Do not discuss cryptocurrency speculation or investment
- Use no more than one analogy per major concept
- Keep the total explanation under 800 words
```

**Result:** A clear, accessible explanation that focuses on the core concepts without overwhelming technical details or tangential topics.

## Example 2: Business Strategy with Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Develop a marketing strategy for our new fitness app.
```

**Result:** A generic strategy that might include impractical or irrelevant suggestions.

**Constrained Prompt:**
```
Develop a marketing strategy for our new fitness app with these constraints:
- Exclude any strategies requiring a budget over $50,000
- Do not include influencer marketing tactics
- Avoid strategies that would take more than 3 months to implement
- Do not suggest any tactics that require significant technical development beyond the app itself
- Exclude traditional advertising channels (TV, radio, print)
- Focus only on digital acquisition channels with measurable ROI
```

**Result:** A focused, practical marketing strategy that fits your budget constraints and timeline while focusing on your preferred channels.

## Example 3: Creative Writing with Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Write a short story about a detective solving a mystery.
```

**Result:** A generic detective story that might rely on common tropes.

**Constrained Prompt:**
```
Write a short story about a detective solving a mystery with these constraints:
- The detective cannot use physical violence at any point
- Do not include any supernatural elements
- The solution cannot involve a coincidence or deus ex machina
- Do not reveal the culprit until the final paragraph
- Avoid common detective story clichés (alcoholism, divorce, "one last case")
- The story must take place entirely within a 24-hour period
- No character can die during the story (though a previous death can be investigated)
```

**Result:** A fresh, creative detective story that avoids typical tropes and follows a tight structure with a satisfying conclusion.

## Example 4: Educational Content with Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Create a lesson plan about photosynthesis for middle school students.
```

**Result:** A standard lesson that might not address specific classroom constraints.

**Constrained Prompt:**
```
Create a lesson plan about photosynthesis for middle school students with these constraints:
- The entire lesson must be completable in a 45-minute class period
- Do not require any materials that cost money or need advance preparation
- Avoid activities requiring students to move around the classroom
- Do not assume access to technology beyond a single classroom computer and projector
- Exclude complex biochemical details while still being scientifically accurate
- Do not include homework assignments
```

**Result:** A practical, focused lesson plan that works within real classroom constraints while effectively teaching the core concepts.

## Example 5: Data Analysis with Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Analyze this customer satisfaction survey data and provide insights.
```

**Result:** A general analysis that might miss your specific business needs.

**Constrained Prompt:**
```
Analyze this customer satisfaction survey data with these constraints:
- Focus only on factors that correlate with churn risk
- Do not discuss demographic patterns unless they show strong correlation with satisfaction scores
- Avoid speculative interpretations without clear data support
- Do not recommend any actions that would require hiring additional staff
- Exclude any insights related to pricing or product features that cannot be changed
- Limit your analysis to actionable findings that could be implemented within 60 days
```

**Result:** A targeted analysis focusing specifically on actionable insights related to customer retention within your operational constraints.

## Example 6: Problem-Solving with Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**
```
Suggest ways to improve our team's productivity.
```

**Result:** Generic productivity advice that might not fit your specific situation.

**Constrained Prompt:**
```
Suggest ways to improve our remote software development team's productivity with these constraints:
- Do not include solutions that require new software purchases
- Avoid suggestions that would require more than 2 hours per week of additional meetings
- Do not recommend changes to our core working hours (9am-3pm overlap required)
- Exclude approaches that would require significant retraining
- Do not suggest hiring additional team members or consultants
- Avoid solutions that would take more than 2 weeks to implement fully
```

**Result:** Practical productivity improvements that work within your team's specific constraints and can be implemented quickly with existing resources.

## The Constraint Framework

When adding constraints to your prompts, consider these categories:

1. **Content Constraints**
   - Topics to exclude
   - Information to omit
   - Perspectives to avoid

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Time limitations
   - Budget restrictions
   - Technology requirements

3. **Format Constraints**
   - Length limitations
   - Structural requirements
   - Presentation restrictions

4. **Approach Constraints**
   - Methods to avoid
   - Techniques to exclude
   - Assumptions to challenge

Remember, effective constraints aren't about making things harder—they're about creating focus and eliminating unhelpful or irrelevant elements from the response. The right constraints can dramatically improve the usefulness of AI outputs by ensuring they align precisely with your practical needs and limitations.
