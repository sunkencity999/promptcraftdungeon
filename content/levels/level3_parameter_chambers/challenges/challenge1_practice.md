# Parameters Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Parameter Identification

Identify all the parameters in the following prompts and categorize them by type (length, format, style, tone, audience, etc.):

1. "Write a 500-word blog post about renewable energy in a conversational tone for a general audience."
2. "Create a formal business proposal for a new software product, including sections for executive summary, market analysis, product description, and financial projections."
3. "Generate a step-by-step tutorial for beginners on how to bake sourdough bread, with each step numbered and including tips for common mistakes."
4. "Compose a heartfelt congratulatory email (150-200 words) to a colleague who just received a promotion."
5. "Design a technical specification document for a mobile app, using bullet points for features and including diagrams where appropriate."

## Exercise 2: Adding Parameters

Enhance the following basic prompts by adding at least three different types of parameters:

1. "Write about climate change."
2. "Create a marketing plan."
3. "Explain quantum computing."
4. "Describe Paris."
5. "Give advice about job interviews."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Write a story about space exploration."
- Enhanced: "Write a 1000-word science fiction story about first contact with an alien civilization, using a suspenseful tone, first-person perspective, and including ethical dilemmas faced by the protagonist."

## Exercise 3: Parameter Precision

For each of the following parameters, provide three different specific values that could be used in a prompt:

1. **Length**: ____________, ____________, and ____________
2. **Tone**: ____________, ____________, and ____________
3. **Format**: ____________, ____________, and ____________
4. **Audience**: ____________, ____________, and ____________
5. **Style**: ____________, ____________, and ____________
6. **Complexity Level**: ____________, ____________, and ____________

## Exercise 4: Parameter Combination Challenge

Create prompts that effectively combine multiple parameters for each of the following scenarios:

1. You need a technical explanation that's accessible to non-experts.
2. You want creative content that follows very specific structural guidelines.
3. You need professional content with a friendly, approachable tone.
4. You want detailed information presented in a visually scannable format.
5. You need content that balances persuasive elements with factual accuracy.

## Exercise 5: Domain-Specific Parameters

Identify parameters that are particularly important in each of these domains and create a prompt that uses them effectively:

1. **Academic Writing**: What parameters ensure scholarly quality?
2. **Marketing Content**: What parameters drive engagement and conversion?
3. **Technical Documentation**: What parameters ensure clarity and usability?
4. **Creative Writing**: What parameters shape narrative and emotional impact?
5. **Educational Content**: What parameters support effective learning?

## Challenge Exercise: Parameter Hierarchy and Conflicts

Sometimes parameters can conflict with each other or need to be prioritized. For each of the following scenarios, create a prompt that includes potentially conflicting parameters and explicitly states which should take priority:

1. A technical explanation that needs to be both comprehensive and brief
2. Content that needs to be both creative/original and adhere to strict guidelines
3. A response that needs to be both simple enough for beginners and accurate enough for experts
4. Content that needs to be both formal/professional and engaging/conversational
5. A document that needs to include complete information while remaining scannable

For each prompt, explicitly state which parameter should take priority if there's a conflict and explain why.
