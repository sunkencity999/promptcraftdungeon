  "description": "A crystalline prism stands on a pedestal, surrounded by swirling colored lights. It seems designed to focus and filter these lights in specific ways.",
  "promptTask": "Goal: Focus the prism to create a specific light pattern.\nLesson: Using parameters to filter and refine outputs.\nCraft a command that uses specific filtering parameters to focus only on certain colors or patterns.",

  "successMessage": "As you direct the prism to focus only on the blue and green light patterns while excluding the red frequencies, the crystal aligns perfectly, projecting a mesmerizing aquatic pattern on the far wall that reveals a hidden doorway.",

    "noParameters": "Parameter Error: Your command needs filtering parameters. Try using terms like 'only,' 'except,' or 'without' to specify what to include or exclude.",
    "incompleteParameters": "Filtering Required: Your command needs to be more specific about which colors or patterns to focus on or filter out.",
