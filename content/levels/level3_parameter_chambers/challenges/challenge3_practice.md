# Multiple Parameters Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Parameter Identification

Analyze the following prompts and identify all the different parameter types used (format, style, quantity, time constraint, audience, tone, etc.):

1. "Create a 5-slide presentation about renewable energy, using a professional tone, with data visualizations, suitable for high school students, to be delivered in 10 minutes."

2. "Write a blog post about artificial intelligence."

3. "Generate a weekly meal plan with 21 Mediterranean diet recipes, including nutritional information for each meal, organized by day, with a shopping list, and focusing only on meals that can be prepared in under 30 minutes."

4. "Explain quantum computing."

5. "Design a marketing campaign for a luxury watch brand targeting affluent professionals aged 35-50, with a sophisticated tone, including 3 social media concepts, 2 print ad concepts, and a 60-second video script, all emphasizing heritage and craftsmanship."

**Questions to consider:**
- How many different parameter types can you identify in each prompt?
- Which prompts would likely produce the most specific and tailored responses?
- What additional parameters could improve the less specific prompts?

## Exercise 2: Parameter Combination

Enhance the following basic prompts by adding at least three different types of parameters:

1. "Write an article about climate change."

2. "Create a business plan."

3. "Design a logo."

4. "Develop a fitness routine."

5. "Explain machine learning algorithms."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Write a story."
- With parameters: "Write a 1,500-word mystery story set in 1920s Paris, using first-person narration from the perspective of a female journalist, with a twist ending, and minimal dialogue, suitable for adult readers of literary fiction."

## Exercise 3: Parameter Type Expansion

For each of the following parameter types, create a prompt that uses that parameter type in a highly specific way:

1. Format parameters (structure, length, organization)
2. Style parameters (tone, voice, linguistic features)
3. Content parameters (topics, themes, elements to include/exclude)
4. Audience parameters (who the content is for)
5. Technical parameters (complexity level, terminology usage)
6. Time parameters (duration, period, deadline)
7. Quantity parameters (numbers, amounts, frequency)
8. Constraint parameters (limitations, requirements)

## Exercise 4: Multi-Parameter Matrix

Create a comprehensive prompt for each of the following scenarios using at least 5 different parameter types:

1. Creating educational content

2. Developing a marketing strategy

3. Designing a product

4. Planning an event

5. Writing a research paper

**Example:**
- "Create an educational video script about photosynthesis (content) for middle school students (audience) that is 3-4 minutes in length (quantity/time), using an enthusiastic and curious tone (style), incorporating 2-3 simple analogies (format/structure), avoiding technical jargon (constraint), including 3 key checkpoints for comprehension (learning parameter), and ending with a brief quiz (assessment parameter)."

## Exercise 5: Parameter Precision

The following prompts use parameters but could be more precise. Refine them to create more targeted requests:

1. "Write a short business email in a professional tone."

2. "Create a simple presentation with a few slides about history."

3. "Design a colorful poster for an event with some key information."

4. "Write a quick guide about a technical topic for beginners."

5. "Make a brief video script with an engaging style."

**Example refinement:**
- Original: "Write a short story in a dramatic style."
- Refined: "Write a 2,500-word psychological thriller short story (format/length) from the perspective of an unreliable narrator (style/perspective), set in a remote lighthouse during a winter storm (setting), incorporating themes of isolation and paranoia (content), with a non-linear timeline (structure), minimal dialogue (constraint), and a morally ambiguous ending (content), suitable for submission to literary fiction magazines (audience/purpose)."

## Exercise 6: Parameter Conflict Resolution

The following prompts contain potentially conflicting parameters. Identify the conflicts and rewrite the prompts to resolve them:

1. "Write a comprehensive yet brief guide to quantum physics that is both technically accurate for experts and easily understandable by complete beginners."

2. "Create a highly detailed marketing plan with specific tactics for a new product launch that can be presented in under 5 minutes and fits on a single page."

3. "Design a minimalist yet feature-rich website homepage that is visually striking but doesn't use any strong colors or bold design elements."

4. "Write a formal academic research paper about climate change that uses casual, conversational language and includes humorous anecdotes while maintaining scientific credibility."

5. "Develop a complex, multi-step cooking recipe that uses exotic ingredients and advanced techniques but can be prepared by novice cooks in under 15 minutes with basic kitchen equipment."

**Example resolution:**
- Conflicting: "Create a data-heavy presentation that includes comprehensive statistics but is visually simple and can be understood at a glance."
- Resolved: "Create a presentation that distills complex data into 5 key visual insights (quantity/format), using executive summary charts (format) that highlight only the most significant trends (content constraint), with each slide having a single clear takeaway (structure), and an appendix containing the comprehensive data tables for reference (organization)."
