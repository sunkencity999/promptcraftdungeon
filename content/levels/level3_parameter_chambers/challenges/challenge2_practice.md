# Parameter Filtering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Filter Parameter Analysis

Analyze the following prompts and identify which ones effectively use filtering parameters:

1. "Give me information about planets."

2. "Provide information about planets in our solar system, excluding gas giants, and focusing only on those with solid surfaces. Include only confirmed facts, not theoretical or speculative information."

3. "List some popular movies."

4. "List action movies from the 2010s with female leads, excluding superhero franchises and including only those with Rotten Tomatoes scores above 85%."

5. "Tell me about different types of tea."

**Questions to consider:**
- What filtering parameters make the effective prompts more precise?
- How do exclusion filters (without, except, excluding) differ from inclusion filters (only, just, specifically)?
- How might the responses differ between the filtered and unfiltered versions?

## Exercise 2: Adding Filter Parameters

Enhance the following basic prompts by adding specific filtering parameters:

1. "Recommend some books."

2. "Provide exercise routines."

3. "List project management tools."

4. "Suggest recipes for dinner."

5. "Give me investment strategies."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Recommend some music."
- With filters: "Recommend instrumental jazz music from the 1960s, specifically albums featuring piano as the lead instrument, excluding vocal performances, and focusing only on recordings considered influential to the modal jazz movement."

## Exercise 3: Exclusion vs. Inclusion Filtering

For each of the following topics, create two different prompts:
1. One that uses primarily exclusion filters (without, except, excluding)
2. One that uses primarily inclusion filters (only, just, specifically, limited to)

Topics:
- Career advice
- Travel destinations
- Smartphone recommendations
- Learning resources for coding
- Health and nutrition information

**Example:**
- Exclusion: "Provide career advice for recent graduates entering the job market, excluding generic tips like 'network more' or 'update your resume,' and without focusing on high-competition fields like investment banking or management consulting."

- Inclusion: "Provide career advice for recent graduates entering the job market, focusing only on specific actionable steps for the first 90 days of employment, limited to professional growth strategies and relationship-building tactics that work specifically in remote work environments."

## Exercise 4: Precision Filtering

For each of the following scenarios, create a prompt with at least three specific filtering parameters that would help generate a highly targeted response:

1. Searching for a new apartment

2. Planning a vacation itinerary

3. Finding a suitable laptop for specific needs

4. Researching medical information about a condition

5. Learning about historical events

**Example:**
- "I'm searching for information about the American Civil War, focusing only on economic factors that contributed to the conflict, excluding military battles and strategies, and limited to peer-reviewed academic sources published in the last 15 years."

## Exercise 5: Filter Combination Challenge

Create prompts that combine both inclusion and exclusion filters effectively for the following requests:

1. Recipe recommendations

2. Movie suggestions

3. Book recommendations

4. Exercise routines

5. Educational resources

**Example:**
- "Recommend documentaries about technology and society released in the last 5 years, focusing specifically on ethical implications of artificial intelligence and data privacy, including only those with runtime under 100 minutes, and excluding any that require specialized technical knowledge to understand."

## Exercise 6: Filter Refinement

The following prompts have some filtering parameters but could be more precise. Refine them to create more targeted requests:

1. "Give me information about dogs, excluding large breeds."

2. "Recommend fantasy novels, only recent ones."

3. "Provide vacation ideas in Europe, without expensive destinations."

4. "Suggest productivity apps, only the popular ones."

5. "List coding tutorials, excluding advanced ones."

**Example refinement:**
- Original: "Give me recipes without meat."
- Refined: "Provide dinner recipes that are completely plant-based (excluding all animal products including meat, dairy, eggs, and honey), focusing only on high-protein options with fewer than 10 ingredients, and limited to dishes that can be prepared in 30 minutes or less."
