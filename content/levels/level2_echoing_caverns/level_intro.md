# The Echoing Caverns

You enter a vast network of caverns where your voice echoes in mysterious ways. In this realm, the specificity of your words matters greatly. The cave system seems to respond differently based on how detailed your commands are.

## Level Overview

In the Echoing Caverns, you'll learn about:

- The importance of **specificity** in prompts
- How to use **descriptive details** to get better results
- The concept of **sequential instructions** and their proper ordering

The challenges in this area will teach you how to craft prompts that are clear, specific, and properly sequenced. The more precise your instructions, the better the AI will understand your intent.

## Level Objectives

1. Master the art of adding specificity to your prompts
2. Learn to craft sequential instructions in the correct order
3. Understand how to communicate with NPCs effectively

Remember that in these caverns, vague echoes get lost, but clear, specific commands will resonate and produce the desired effects.
