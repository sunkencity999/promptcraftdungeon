# Specificity Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Specificity Analysis

Analyze the following prompts and rate them on a specificity scale from 1 (very vague) to 5 (highly specific):

1. "Write a story."
2. "Create a 500-word fantasy short story about a young wizard discovering an ancient spell book in a forgotten library."
3. "Help with my homework."
4. "Explain photosynthesis."
5. "Provide a step-by-step explanation of photosynthesis suitable for a 10th-grade biology student, including the light-dependent and light-independent reactions, with an emphasis on energy transformation."

**Questions to consider:**
- What details make the more specific prompts effective?
- What information is missing from the vague prompts?
- How would you improve the less specific prompts?

## Exercise 2: Adding Specificity

Enhance the following vague prompts by adding specific details:

1. "Write a recipe."
2. "Give me travel tips."
3. "Help me with exercise."
4. "Design a logo."
5. "Explain how to code."

**Example enhancement:**
- Vague: "Write a poem."
- Specific: "Write a 12-line sonnet about autumn leaves falling in a city park, using vivid color imagery and a contemplative tone."

## Exercise 3: Specificity Categories

For each of the following prompts, identify which specificity elements are missing (Quantity, Format, Audience, Style, Context, or Purpose):

1. "Create a marketing plan for a new smartphone."
2. "Write instructions for assembling a desk."
3. "Design a presentation about climate change."
4. "Develop a workout routine."
5. "Compose an email to a client."

Then, rewrite each prompt to include the missing elements.

## Exercise 4: Precision Challenge

Each of the following scenarios requires a highly specific prompt. Create a detailed prompt for each situation:

1. You need an AI to generate a custom meal plan for someone with specific dietary restrictions.
2. You want to create a detailed character description for a fantasy novel.
3. You need instructions for troubleshooting a specific technical problem.
4. You want feedback on a piece of writing you've created.
5. You need to create a project timeline with specific milestones.

## Exercise 5: Specificity in Different Domains

Apply the principles of specificity to create detailed prompts in each of these domains:

1. **Education**: A prompt asking for a lesson plan
2. **Business**: A prompt requesting a market analysis
3. **Creative**: A prompt for generating a fictional scene
4. **Technical**: A prompt asking for code explanation
5. **Personal**: A prompt for getting personalized advice

## Challenge Exercise: Balancing Specificity and Flexibility

Sometimes you want to provide specific guidance while still allowing for creativity or exploration. For each of the following scenarios, create a prompt that balances specific requirements with room for the AI to contribute its own insights:

1. Brainstorming product ideas within specific constraints
2. Creating a character that fits into an established story world
3. Generating multiple approaches to solving a defined problem
4. Designing a space that meets specific functional requirements
5. Developing a communication strategy with required elements

For each prompt, explicitly identify which elements you're specifying precisely and which areas you're intentionally leaving open for the AI to explore.
