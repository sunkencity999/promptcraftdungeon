# Specificity in Action: Real-World Examples

## Example 1: Product Search

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Show me some laptops.
```

**Result:** An overwhelming list of random laptops with no focus on your actual needs.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Show me lightweight laptops (under 3 pounds) with at least 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and 12+ hour battery life that are suitable for video editing, with a budget of $1200-1800.
```

**Result:** A curated selection of laptops that precisely match your requirements, saving you time filtering through irrelevant options.

## Example 2: Writing Assistance

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Write an email to my team.
```

**Result:** A generic email that likely misses your intended purpose and tone.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Write a professional email to my marketing team of 8 people announcing the postponement of our product launch from May 15th to June 30th due to supply chain issues. Express confidence in meeting the new timeline, request updated marketing deliverables by June 1st, and maintain an optimistic but transparent tone. The email should be concise (150-200 words) and include a clear subject line.
```

**Result:** A tailored email that addresses exactly what you need to communicate, in the right tone, with all necessary details.

## Example 3: Creative Request

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Design a character for me.
```

**Result:** A character with random attributes that may not fit your needs or vision.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Design a female protagonist character for a young adult fantasy novel set in a Nordic-inspired world. She should be 17-19 years old with the unusual ability to communicate with ice spirits. Include details about her physical appearance (emphasizing features that reflect her connection to winter elements), personality traits (including one significant flaw), her background as the daughter of a village healer, and a unique item she carries that symbolizes her heritage. The character should challenge traditional fantasy heroine tropes while remaining relatable to teenage readers.
```

**Result:** A well-developed character with consistent attributes that align with your creative vision and narrative needs.

## Example 4: Technical Support

**Vague Prompt:**
```
My computer isn't working. Help me fix it.
```

**Result:** Generic troubleshooting steps that may not address your specific issue.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
I'm using a Dell XPS 15 (2022 model) running Windows 11 (latest update). When I try to connect to my home WiFi network, it connects for about 2 minutes and then disconnects with the error message "Can't connect to this network." This started happening yesterday after a system update. I've already tried restarting the computer and router, forgetting and reconnecting to the network, and running the Windows network troubleshooter (which found no issues). Other devices in my home connect to the WiFi without problems. Please provide specific troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue.
```

**Result:** Targeted troubleshooting advice that addresses your exact situation, saving time and frustration.

## Example 5: Educational Request

**Vague Prompt:**
```
Explain quantum computing.
```

**Result:** A general explanation that might be too technical, too simple, or not focused on what you actually want to learn.

**Specific Prompt:**
```
Explain the basic principles of quantum computing to a college student with a strong background in classical computing but no quantum physics knowledge. Focus specifically on quantum bits (qubits), superposition, and entanglement. Use analogies to classical computing concepts where helpful, avoid complex mathematical formulations, and include a simple example of a problem where quantum computing has a theoretical advantage over classical computing. Limit the explanation to approximately 500 words.
```

**Result:** An educational explanation tailored to your background knowledge, focusing on the aspects you want to learn about, at an appropriate level of detail.

## Why These Examples Work

The specific prompts succeed because they include:

1. **Context**: Background information that frames the request
2. **Parameters**: Clear boundaries and specifications
3. **Purpose**: Why you need the information or content
4. **Format**: How you want the information structured or presented
5. **Audience**: Who the content is intended for (if applicable)
6. **Tone/Style**: The desired voice or approach
7. **Scope**: The breadth or depth of information needed

By including these elements in your prompts, you dramatically increase the likelihood of getting exactly what you need on the first attempt.
