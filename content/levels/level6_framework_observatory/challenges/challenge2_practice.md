# Role-Task-Format Framework Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: RTF Component Identification

Analyze the following prompts and identify which ones effectively use the complete Role-Task-Format framework:

1. "Explain quantum computing."

2. "As a physics professor teaching non-science majors, explain quantum computing fundamentals in the form of an engaging 5-minute lecture script with everyday analogies and visual description cues."

3. "Create a marketing plan for a new product."

4. "Analyze the latest economic data."

5. "In the role of a financial analyst with expertise in emerging markets, analyze the latest economic indicators from Southeast Asian economies and present your findings in the format of a concise executive briefing with three key insights and supporting data visualizations."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts clearly specify all three RTF components?
- How does the presence of a complete RTF framework affect the specificity of the expected response?
- What assumptions might need to be made when components are missing?

## Exercise 2: RTF Component Development

For each of the following basic prompts, develop complete RTF versions by adding the missing components:

1. "Write about climate change."

2. "Give advice on public speaking."

3. "Compare different project management methodologies."

4. "Explain the importance of cybersecurity."

5. "Describe effective leadership strategies."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Write about artificial intelligence."
- Complete RTF: "As a technology ethicist with expertise in emerging AI systems, write about the societal implications of generative AI technologies in the format of a balanced opinion piece suitable for an educated general audience, including specific examples of both potential benefits and risks."

## Exercise 3: Role Variation

For the same task and format, create prompts with five different roles that would produce notably different responses:

Task: "Analyze the implications of remote work"
Format: "In the form of a structured report with recommendations"

Create prompts specifying these roles:
1. A human resources professional
2. A commercial real estate expert
3. A work-life balance psychologist
4. An environmental sustainability consultant
5. A cybersecurity specialist

**Example for the HR professional:**
"As a senior human resources professional with experience in organizational development, analyze the implications of remote work for company culture and employee engagement, and present your analysis in the form of a structured report with specific recommendations for maintaining team cohesion in hybrid work environments."

## Exercise 4: Task Precision

For the same role and format, create prompts with five different precisely specified tasks:

Role: "As a digital marketing specialist"
Format: "In the form of a step-by-step guide"

Create prompts specifying these tasks:
1. Conducting a social media audit
2. Creating a content calendar
3. Optimizing landing page conversion rates
4. Developing a customer persona
5. Analyzing marketing campaign performance

**Example for social media audit:**
"As a digital marketing specialist with expertise in platform analytics, create a comprehensive framework for conducting a social media audit that identifies engagement gaps and content opportunities, and present it in the form of a step-by-step guide that includes specific metrics to track, benchmark comparisons, and a timeline for implementation."

## Exercise 5: Format Specificity

For the same role and task, create prompts with five different precisely specified formats:

Role: "As a nutritionist"
Task: "Explain the principles of balanced meal planning"

Create prompts specifying these formats:
1. An infographic description
2. A weekly meal planning template
3. A FAQ document
4. A comparison chart
5. A decision tree

**Example for infographic description:**
"As a nutritionist specializing in practical everyday nutrition, explain the principles of balanced meal planning in the form of a visually-oriented infographic description that uses the plate method as its central organizing concept, includes color-coding for different food groups, and features 5-7 simple rules that can be applied to any meal."

## Exercise 6: Complete RTF Synthesis

Create comprehensive RTF framework prompts for the following scenarios:

1. Getting advice on personal finance management

2. Learning about a historical event

3. Understanding a scientific concept

4. Developing a business strategy

5. Creating educational content

For each scenario, create a prompt with a highly specific role, task, and format that work together coherently.

**Example:**
"As a behavioral economist specializing in household financial decision-making (role), analyze the psychological barriers that prevent people from effective retirement saving and develop practical intervention strategies to overcome these barriers (task), presented in the format of a two-part framework that first maps common cognitive biases to specific saving behaviors and then provides corresponding 'nudge' techniques with real-world implementation examples for each bias-behavior pair (format)."
