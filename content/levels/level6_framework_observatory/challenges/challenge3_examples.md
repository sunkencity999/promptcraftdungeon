## The Multi-Stage Selection Framework

When designing multi-stage prompting approaches, consider:

1. **Task Complexity and Type**
   - Analysis tasks → Depth-increasing or perspective-shifting stages
   - Decision making → Conditional branching or divergent-convergent stages
   - Creative development → Iterative refinement stages
   - Research synthesis → Recursive deepening stages
   - Strategic planning → Linear sequential stages

2. **Information Flow Management**
   - Ensure critical outputs from each stage are explicitly carried forward
   - Consider summarization requirements between stages
   - Use clear referencing to previous stage outputs
   - Maintain consistent terminology across stages

3. **Stage Sequence Logic**
   - Ensure each stage builds logically on previous stages
   - Consider dependencies between different aspects of the task
   - Determine whether linear or non-linear progression is more appropriate
   - Identify where iteration or conditional branching adds value

4. **Practical Implementation**
   - Balance comprehensiveness with usability
   - Consider the appropriate number of stages (typically 4-7 for complex tasks)
   - Use clear stage labeling and transitions
   - Include verification steps at critical junctures

Remember, effective multi-stage prompting isn't about making tasks unnecessarily complex—it's about breaking down complex tasks into manageable, logical sequences that ensure thorough, high-quality results that would be difficult to achieve with a single prompt.
