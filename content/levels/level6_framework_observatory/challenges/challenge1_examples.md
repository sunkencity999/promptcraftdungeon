- User feedback patterns from app store reviews and support tickets
- Retention data correlated with feature usage

SOLUTIONS:
Develop potential solutions addressing each major cause, including:
- UX improvements to the workout logging flow
- Integration expansion opportunities
- Feature enhancements based on competitive gaps
- Engagement mechanism improvements

EVALUATION:
Assess each solution based on:
- Estimated impact on retention and engagement

## The Framework Selection Guide

When choosing a structured framework for your prompts, consider:

1. **Task Complexity**
   - Simple tasks → Basic Role-Task-Format framework
   - Complex analysis → ASPECT or Problem-Solution framework
   - Decision making → Decision Framework
   - Strategy development → CRISPE framework
   - Iterative refinement → Multi-phase frameworks

2. **Output Requirements**
   - Need for comprehensive coverage → Choose frameworks with explicit components for all required elements
   - Need for prioritization → Include evaluation and ranking components
   - Need for actionability → Ensure implementation or transformation components
