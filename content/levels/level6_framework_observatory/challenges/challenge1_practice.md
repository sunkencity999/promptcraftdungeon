# Structured Frameworks Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Framework Identification

Analyze the following prompts and identify which structured frameworks they're using:

1. "As a cybersecurity expert, analyze the following network logs for potential intrusion attempts. Present your findings in a bulleted list with severity ratings for each identified threat."

2. "CONTEXT: A mid-sized retail company is experiencing high employee turnover.
   TASK: Develop a comprehensive employee retention strategy.
   CONSTRAINTS: Must be implementable within 3 months and with minimal budget impact.
   FORMAT: Present as a 5-point action plan with implementation timeline."

3. "You are a historical biographer researching Abraham Lincoln. Using primary sources only, analyze his leadership approach during the Civil War. Structure your analysis using the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)."

4. "PERSONA: Environmental policy advisor
   AUDIENCE: Local government officials
   CONTEXT: Increasing urban flooding due to climate change
   TASK: Recommend infrastructure adaptations
   CONSTRAINTS: Limited municipal budget, must prioritize vulnerable communities
   FORMAT: 2-page policy brief with executive summary and implementation roadmap"

5. "As a curriculum designer, create a lesson plan for teaching photosynthesis to 5th graders. Include learning objectives, required materials, step-by-step activities, assessment methods, and differentiation strategies for various learning needs."

## Exercise 2: Framework Application

Apply the Role-Task-Format-Constraint (RTFC) framework to create structured prompts for the following scenarios:

1. Getting nutrition advice for a specific health condition
2. Analyzing a literary work for themes and symbolism
3. Troubleshooting a technical problem with a computer
4. Planning a marketing campaign for a new product
5. Designing an exercise program for specific fitness goals

**Example application:**
```
ROLE: As a certified financial planner with expertise in retirement planning
TASK: Analyze the current retirement savings strategy described below and identify optimization opportunities
FORMAT: Provide analysis as a structured report with sections for current status, identified issues, and prioritized recommendations
CONSTRAINTS: Focus only on tax-advantaged strategies and exclude high-risk investment options
```

## Exercise 3: Framework Expansion

Take the following basic prompts and expand them using the AUDIENCE-CONTEXT-TASK-FORMAT-CONSTRAINTS (ACTFC) framework:

1. "Explain quantum computing."
2. "Give tips for growing tomatoes."
3. "Analyze this company's financial performance."
4. "Suggest team-building activities."
5. "Describe effective study techniques."

**Example expansion:**
- Basic: "Explain artificial intelligence."
- Expanded:
  ```
  AUDIENCE: High school students with basic computer science knowledge
  CONTEXT: Preparing for a science fair project on AI applications
  TASK: Explain core AI concepts and current applications in everyday technology
  FORMAT: Create an engaging 5-minute presentation script with 3 visual concept analogies
  CONSTRAINTS: Avoid technical jargon, mathematical formulas, and speculative future scenarios
  ```

## Exercise 4: Custom Framework Design

Design a custom prompt framework for each of the following specialized contexts:

1. Medical diagnosis assistance
2. Creative writing feedback
3. Product design evaluation
4. Historical event analysis
5. Personal productivity coaching

For each framework, identify:
- The key components needed
- The logical sequence of these components
- Example labels and instructions for each component
- A sample prompt using your framework

## Exercise 5: Framework Adaptation

Take the following structured framework and adapt it for three different purposes while maintaining its core structure:

```
ROLE: [Expert identity]
AUDIENCE: [Who will receive this information]
CONTEXT: [Relevant background information]
OBJECTIVE: [What needs to be accomplished]
APPROACH: [How to tackle the objective]
FORMAT: [How to structure the response]
TONE: [Communication style to use]
CONSTRAINTS: [Limitations or exclusions]
```

Adapt this framework for:
1. Educational content creation
2. Business decision-making
3. Technical troubleshooting
4. Creative project development
5. Personal advice giving

## Challenge Exercise: Multi-Level Framework Integration

Create a sophisticated prompt using nested frameworks for a complex scenario. Your prompt should:

1. Use a primary framework to establish the overall structure
2. Incorporate secondary frameworks for specific components
3. Include clear instructions for how the frameworks interact
4. Provide guidance on prioritization when framework elements might conflict
5. Balance comprehensiveness with usability

Choose one of the following complex scenarios:
- Developing a comprehensive business strategy
- Creating an interdisciplinary research proposal
- Designing a complex software system
- Planning a multi-faceted community development project
- Analyzing a complex global issue from multiple perspectives

Your goal is to create a prompt framework that provides sufficient structure for consistency while allowing enough flexibility for creativity and adaptation.
