# Structured Frameworks for Advanced Prompts

## Core Concept

Structured frameworks are organized approaches to prompt engineering that provide consistent, reusable templates for complex tasks. These frameworks help ensure comprehensive coverage of a topic, maintain logical flow, and produce consistent results across similar prompts.

## Why Structured Frameworks Matter

1. **Consistency**: Frameworks ensure similar problems are approached with the same rigor and methodology.

2. **Comprehensiveness**: Well-designed frameworks help prevent overlooking important aspects of complex topics.

3. **Efficiency**: Once developed, frameworks can be reused and adapted, saving time on similar tasks.

4. **Quality**: Structured approaches typically produce more thorough, balanced, and well-reasoned responses.

5. **Scalability**: Frameworks can be shared across teams and organizations to standardize prompt engineering practices.

## Common Types of Prompt Frameworks

### 1. Role-Task-Format Framework

A simple but powerful framework that clearly defines who, what, and how:

```
ROLE: [Specific expertise or perspective]
TASK: [Clear description of what needs to be done]
FORMAT: [Specific structure for the response]

Example:
ROLE: As a financial risk analyst with expertise in market volatility
TASK: Evaluate the potential risks of investing in emerging cryptocurrency markets
FORMAT: Present your analysis with sections for market risks, regulatory risks, technological risks, and mitigation strategies
```

### 2. CRISPE Framework

A comprehensive framework focusing on different aspects of the prompt:

```
Capacity and Role: [Expertise or perspective to adopt]
Insight: [Specific knowledge or insight to apply]
Specific Task: [Clear description of what to do]
Personality: [Tone or communication style]
Experiment: [Specific approach or methodology]

Example:
Capacity and Role: As a UX researcher with expertise in e-commerce
Insight: Drawing on knowledge of latest mobile shopping behavior studies
Specific Task: Analyze this checkout flow and identify potential friction points
Personality: Be constructively critical but solution-oriented
Experiment: Approach the analysis as if you were conducting a cognitive walkthrough with typical users
```

### 3. ASPECT Framework

A framework focused on comprehensive analysis:

```
Analyze: [What to examine]
Specify: [Particular aspects to focus on]
Perspective: [Viewpoint to adopt]
Evaluate: [How to assess]
Conclude: [What type of conclusion to reach]
Transform: [How to apply or implement findings]

Example:
Analyze: This marketing campaign data
Specify: Focus on conversion rates, engagement metrics, and ROI
Perspective: As a digital marketing specialist
Evaluate: Compare performance against industry benchmarks and previous campaigns
Conclude: With key insights about what worked and what didn't
Transform: Into actionable recommendations for the next campaign
```

### 4. Decision Framework

A structure for evaluating options and making recommendations:

```
CONTEXT: [Situation background]
OPTIONS: [Alternatives to consider]
CRITERIA: [Evaluation standards]
ANALYSIS: [Systematic evaluation]
RECOMMENDATION: [Clear guidance]
IMPLEMENTATION: [Next steps]

Example:
CONTEXT: Our small business needs a CRM solution
OPTIONS: Consider Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, and Pipedrive
CRITERIA: Evaluate based on cost, scalability, ease of use, and integration capabilities
ANALYSIS: Systematically compare each option against all criteria
RECOMMENDATION: Identify the best option with clear rationale
IMPLEMENTATION: Outline steps for adoption and migration
```

### 5. Problem-Solution Framework

A structure for addressing challenges:

```
PROBLEM: [Clear definition of the issue]
IMPACT: [Consequences and importance]
ROOT CAUSES: [Underlying factors]
SOLUTIONS: [Potential approaches]
EVALUATION: [Assessment of solutions]
RECOMMENDATION: [Best approach]
ACTION PLAN: [Implementation steps]

Example:
PROBLEM: High shopping cart abandonment rate (68%)
IMPACT: Estimated $120,000 monthly revenue loss
ROOT CAUSES: Analyze potential reasons with evidence
SOLUTIONS: Present 3-4 potential approaches to address each major cause
EVALUATION: Assess each solution for effectiveness, implementation difficulty, and cost
RECOMMENDATION: Identify the optimal solution strategy
ACTION PLAN: Provide specific implementation steps with timeline
```

## How to Create Effective Prompt Frameworks

### 1. Start with Clear Objectives

Define what the framework needs to accomplish:
- What type of task is it designed for?
- What are the critical elements that must be addressed?
- What are common pitfalls to avoid?

### 2. Identify Key Components

Break down the task into logical sections or steps:
- What information is needed at the beginning?
- What analysis or processing should happen?
- What should the output include?

### 3. Create Clear Labels and Instructions

For each component of the framework:
- Use consistent, descriptive labels
- Provide clear instructions about what belongs in each section
- Include examples if helpful

### 4. Test and Refine

Evaluate the framework's effectiveness:
- Does it produce the desired results?
- Are there gaps or redundancies?
- Is it clear and easy to use?

### 5. Document and Share

Create clear documentation for your framework:
- When and how to use it
- How to adapt it for different situations
- Examples of successful implementation

## Advanced Framework Techniques

### 1. Nested Frameworks

Incorporate sub-frameworks within larger structures:

```
STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:
  [Use SWOT framework here]

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
  [Use project management framework here]
```

### 2. Conditional Elements

Include optional components based on specific conditions:

```
RISK ASSESSMENT:
  [If dealing with financial products, include regulatory compliance section]
  [If dealing with consumer products, include safety evaluation section]
```

### 3. Iterative Frameworks

Design frameworks that build upon previous outputs:

```
INITIAL ANALYSIS: [First-pass evaluation]
CRITICAL REVIEW: [Examination of initial analysis]
REFINEMENT: [Improvements based on review]
FINAL RECOMMENDATION: [Conclusion after iteration]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overly Rigid Frameworks**: Too much structure can limit creativity and adaptability.

2. **Framework Overload**: Using too many components can make prompts unwieldy.

3. **Unclear Instructions**: Vague directions within a framework defeat its purpose.

4. **Misaligned Frameworks**: Using a framework ill-suited to the specific task.

## Practical Exercise

Transform this basic prompt:
"Give me ideas for my business."

Using a structured framework:

```
BUSINESS INNOVATION FRAMEWORK

CONTEXT:
Provide a brief description of your business, including industry, size, target customers, and current challenges or goals.

INNOVATION AREAS:
I will analyze opportunities in these key areas:
1. Product/Service Enhancements
2. Customer Experience Improvements
3. Operational Efficiency
4. Market Expansion
5. Business Model Innovation

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
For each area, I will:
- Identify 2-3 specific opportunities
- Evaluate feasibility, potential impact, and resource requirements
- Consider short-term vs. long-term implementation

PRIORITIZATION:
I will conclude with a prioritized list of recommendations based on:
- Alignment with your stated goals
- Potential ROI
- Implementation complexity
- Competitive advantage created

Please provide the context information so I can generate tailored innovation ideas for your business.
```

## Remember

Effective frameworks provide structure without sacrificing flexibility. The best frameworks guide thinking and ensure comprehensive coverage while allowing room for creativity and adaptation to specific circumstances.
