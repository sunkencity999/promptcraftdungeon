# Multi-Stage Prompting Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Multi-Stage Structure Analysis

Analyze the following prompts and identify which ones effectively use multi-stage prompting:

1. "Analyze the short story 'The Lottery' by Shirley Jackson."

2. "Analyze the short story 'The Lottery' by Shirley Jackson using a three-stage approach: First, identify and summarize the key narrative elements including setting, characters, and plot progression. Then, examine the symbolic elements and thematic devices used throughout the text, with specific textual examples. Finally, interpret the social commentary and critique embedded in the story, connecting it to both its historical context and contemporary relevance."

3. "Create a marketing strategy for a new product."

4. "Help me write a research paper."

5. "Develop a comprehensive research paper outline through the following stages: First, analyze the research question to identify 3-5 key components that need to be addressed. Next, for each component, identify the types of evidence and sources needed, creating a structured evidence map. Then, organize these components into a logical flow with clear section headings and subheadings. After that, develop specific thesis statements for each major section that support the overall argument. Finally, create a methodology section that outlines how the research will be conducted, including data collection and analysis approaches."

**Questions to consider:**
- How does breaking tasks into sequential stages improve clarity and specificity?
- Which prompts show clear logical progression between stages?
- How might the responses differ between single-stage and multi-stage prompts?

## Exercise 2: Sequential Stage Development

For each of the following basic prompts, develop multi-stage versions with at least three clearly sequenced steps:

1. "Analyze a company's financial health."

2. "Create a learning plan for a new skill."

3. "Design a user research strategy."

4. "Develop a content marketing plan."

5. "Plan a home renovation project."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Help me solve this business problem."
- Multi-stage: "Help me solve this business problem through a structured approach: First, analyze the current situation by identifying key stakeholders, core issues, and relevant constraints based on the information provided. Then, generate at least three potential solutions, evaluating each based on feasibility, resource requirements, and potential impact. Finally, develop an implementation plan for the most promising solution, including specific action steps, timeline, required resources, and success metrics."

## Exercise 3: Logical Flow Analysis

Examine these multi-stage prompts and identify any logical flow problems. Then rewrite them to create a more logical sequence:

1. "Create a business proposal by: 1) Designing the visual layout and branding, 2) Researching the target market, 3) Developing the core value proposition, 4) Identifying the problem being solved, 5) Creating an executive summary."

2. "Analyze a dataset through these steps: 1) Draw conclusions about trends, 2) Clean the data and handle missing values, 3) Collect the raw data, 4) Visualize key relationships, 5) Perform statistical tests."

3. "Develop a character for a novel by: 1) Writing sample dialogue for the character, 2) Creating a character background, 3) Deciding on the character's role in the plot, 4) Identifying their key personality traits, 5) Determining how they will evolve throughout the story."

## Exercise 4: Dependency Mapping

For each of the following multi-stage prompts, identify the dependencies between stages (where one stage must be completed before another can begin):

1. "Create a comprehensive business plan through these stages: 1) Conduct market research to identify target customers and competitors, 2) Define your unique value proposition and product/service offerings, 3) Develop financial projections including startup costs, revenue forecasts, and break-even analysis, 4) Create a marketing and sales strategy to reach your target audience, 5) Outline operational requirements including staffing, facilities, and supply chain considerations."

2. "Design a mobile app through this process: 1) Define user personas and key use cases, 2) Create user flows for primary app functions, 3) Develop low-fidelity wireframes for critical screens, 4) Design the visual identity including color scheme and typography, 5) Create high-fidelity mockups incorporating the visual identity, 6) Develop an interactive prototype for user testing."

3. "Write a research paper using this approach: 1) Formulate a specific research question and hypothesis, 2) Conduct a literature review of existing research on the topic, 3) Design a methodology to test your hypothesis, 4) Collect and analyze data according to your methodology, 5) Interpret your findings in relation to your hypothesis and existing literature, 6) Draft your conclusions and implications for future research."

For each prompt, create a dependency diagram or list that shows which stages depend on others being completed first.

## Exercise 5: Stage Detail Specification

The following multi-stage prompts lack sufficient detail about what should happen in each stage. Rewrite them to provide more specific guidance for each step:

1. "Analyze a poem in three stages: 1) Examine the structure, 2) Look at the language, 3) Interpret the meaning."

2. "Create a business strategy through these steps: 1) Analyze the market, 2) Identify opportunities, 3) Develop strategic initiatives, 4) Create an implementation plan."

3. "Design a website using this process: 1) Plan the site, 2) Create wireframes, 3) Develop the visual design, 4) Build the site, 5) Test and launch."

**Example enhancement:**
- Original: "Analyze data in three steps: 1) Clean the data, 2) Visualize the data, 3) Draw conclusions."
- Enhanced: "Analyze data in three steps: 1) Clean the data by identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing outliers with specific statistical methods, 2) Visualize the data by creating at least three different types of visualizations (scatter plots for relationships, time series for trends, and distribution charts for patterns), each with clear labels, appropriate scales, and visual highlights of key insights, 3) Draw conclusions by identifying statistically significant patterns, comparing results against the initial hypotheses, quantifying the confidence levels of your findings, and outlining specific limitations of the analysis."

## Exercise 6: Cross-Disciplinary Multi-Stage Prompts

Create comprehensive multi-stage prompts for complex tasks that span multiple disciplines or domains:

1. Launching a new product (spanning market research, product development, marketing, and sales)

2. Creating a documentary film (spanning research, storytelling, production, and distribution)

3. Developing a public health campaign (spanning medical research, communication strategy, community engagement, and impact assessment)

4. Designing a smart city initiative (spanning urban planning, technology implementation, policy development, and community engagement)

5. Creating an educational curriculum (spanning learning theory, content development, assessment design, and implementation planning)

For each task, create a prompt with at least 5 stages that span the different disciplines involved, ensuring a logical flow and clear dependencies between stages.

**Example:**
"Develop a comprehensive sustainability strategy for a mid-sized manufacturing company through these sequential stages:

1) Assessment Stage: First, conduct a baseline analysis by identifying all environmental impact sources throughout the company's operations, quantifying current resource usage (energy, water, materials) and waste generation, mapping the full supply chain for environmental hotspots, and benchmarking against industry standards and competitors.

2) Strategic Planning Stage: Next, establish specific sustainability goals based on the assessment findings, prioritizing initiatives using a matrix that weighs environmental impact against implementation feasibility, identifying relevant sustainability frameworks and certifications to align with, and developing a business case that quantifies both costs and benefits (including risk mitigation).

3) Technical Solution Stage: Then, develop specific technical interventions for the highest-priority impact areas, including process modifications to reduce resource consumption, waste management systems that prioritize reduction and recycling, supply chain engagement strategies to address upstream impacts, and metrics for measuring progress against established goals.

4) Organizational Integration Stage: After that, create an implementation framework that embeds sustainability into existing business processes, including necessary policy and procedure updates, staff training and engagement programs, incentive structures that reward sustainable practices, and clear roles and responsibilities for sustainability initiatives.

5) Measurement and Communication Stage: Finally, design a comprehensive reporting system that tracks progress against goals, includes both leading and lagging indicators, aligns with recognized reporting frameworks (such as GRI or SASB), and effectively communicates results to different stakeholders (employees, customers, investors, and regulators)."
