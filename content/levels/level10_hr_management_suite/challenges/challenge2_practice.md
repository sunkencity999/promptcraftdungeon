# Performance Evaluation Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Performance Evaluation Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following performance evaluation prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Write a performance review."

2. "Create a comprehensive performance evaluation for a mid-level software developer who has shown strong technical skills but struggles with communication and meeting deadlines. Include specific sections for: technical competencies (coding, debugging, system design), project delivery (timeliness, quality, documentation), teamwork and collaboration (communication, knowledge sharing, responsiveness), and professional development (learning new skills, adapting to changing requirements). For each section, provide a balanced assessment that acknowledges strengths, identifies specific areas for improvement with concrete examples, and offers actionable development recommendations. Maintain a constructive tone throughout that encourages growth rather than focusing solely on deficiencies."

3. "Evaluate this employee's performance."

4. "Draft a quarterly performance evaluation for a customer service representative who has consistently exceeded call quality metrics but is falling below target on call resolution time. The evaluation should begin with a brief summary of overall performance, then assess specific areas including: call quality metrics (with actual numbers comparing performance to targets), first-call resolution rate, customer satisfaction scores, adherence to protocols, and team contributions. Include specific examples of both exceptional service interactions and situations where improvement is needed. Conclude with 2-3 specific, measurable goals for the next quarter and recommended resources or training to support improvement. Use a supportive, growth-oriented tone while clearly communicating performance expectations."

5. "Give feedback to my team member."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts provide specific evaluation categories or dimensions?
- Which prompts balance recognition of strengths with areas for improvement?
- Which prompts request actionable recommendations or development goals?
- How do the detailed prompts guide more constructive and comprehensive evaluations?

## Exercise 2: Evaluation Structure Development

Enhance the following basic performance evaluation prompts by adding specific evaluation categories, balanced assessment requirements, and requests for actionable recommendations:

1. "Write a performance review for a marketing specialist."

2. "Create an evaluation for a project manager."

3. "Draft a performance assessment for a financial analyst."

4. "Develop a review for a retail store manager."

5. "Write an evaluation for a healthcare professional."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Write a performance review for a teacher."
- Enhanced: "Create a comprehensive semi-annual performance evaluation for a high school science teacher with 5 years of experience. Structure the evaluation with these specific sections:
  1. Instructional effectiveness (lesson planning, content knowledge, teaching methods, student engagement)
  2. Assessment and student achievement (assessment design, grading practices, student progress metrics)
  3. Classroom management and learning environment (behavioral management, inclusive practices, physical space organization)
  4. Professional responsibilities (collaboration with colleagues, communication with parents, professional development participation)
  5. Innovation and adaptation (implementation of new teaching strategies, technology integration, curriculum development)
  
  For each section, include: specific observed strengths with examples, areas for growth with concrete instances, and actionable development recommendations that include both resources and measurable goals. Maintain a growth-oriented tone that recognizes the teacher's experience while encouraging continuous improvement. Conclude with 2-3 priority focus areas for the next evaluation period."

## Exercise 3: Balanced Feedback Formulation

For each of the following performance scenarios, create a prompt that specifically requests balanced feedback that acknowledges both strengths and development areas:

1. An employee who excels technically but struggles with interpersonal skills

2. A team member who is highly creative but inconsistent in delivering results

3. A manager who is supportive of their team but avoids difficult conversations

4. An employee who meets all deadlines but produces work that requires significant revision

5. A team member who is excellent with clients but frequently creates internal tension

**Example:**
"Draft a balanced performance evaluation for a marketing coordinator who consistently produces highly creative campaign concepts but frequently misses internal deadlines and submission requirements. The evaluation should:

1. Begin by acknowledging the significant value their creative thinking brings to the team, with 2-3 specific examples of campaigns where their concepts directly contributed to client satisfaction or business results.

2. Clearly address the pattern of missed deadlines and incomplete submissions, quantifying the impact (e.g., delayed launches, additional team hours required) with specific instances from the past quarter.

3. Explore potential underlying factors for these challenges (such as prioritization issues, process misunderstandings, or resource constraints) without making assumptions or excuses.

4. Provide specific, actionable recommendations that leverage their creative strengths while developing their project management capabilities.

5. Include measurable improvement goals for the next quarter related to both enhancing their creative contributions and meeting operational requirements.

6. Maintain a supportive tone that conveys confidence in their ability to develop in these areas while being clear about performance expectations.

The evaluation should avoid both overly harsh criticism that might discourage their creative contributions and vague feedback that doesn't clearly communicate the seriousness of the operational issues."

## Exercise 4: Specificity and Evidence

Create prompts that request performance evaluations with high levels of specificity and concrete evidence for the following roles:

1. A sales representative

2. A research scientist

3. A customer support manager

4. A software development team lead

5. A human resources specialist

For each role, your prompt should request specific metrics, examples, and observations that provide evidence for the evaluation.

**Example:**
"Create a data-driven annual performance evaluation for a sales representative that uses specific metrics and concrete examples throughout. The evaluation should include:

1. Sales performance section with exact figures for:
   - Percentage of target achieved for each quarter and annually
   - Year-over-year growth in their territory
   - Average deal size and how it compares to team average
   - Conversion rate at each stage of the sales pipeline
   - Client retention rate and expansion revenue

2. Sales process adherence with specific examples of:
   - CRM data quality and timeliness (with compliance percentage)
   - Following up on leads within established timeframes (with response time metrics)
   - Proper implementation of the sales methodology (with specific client examples)

3. Client relationship management with:
   - Client satisfaction scores from formal feedback
   - Specific examples of positive client feedback (direct quotes if available)
   - Instances of effective handling of client concerns or objections
   - Examples of successful needs analysis that led to appropriate solutions

4. Team contribution with concrete examples of:
   - Knowledge sharing with colleagues (specific instances)
   - Participation in team initiatives (with measurable contributions)
   - Mentoring or supporting newer team members (with specific outcomes)

For each area assessed as needing improvement, include at least one specific instance that illustrates the issue, rather than general statements. Conclude with 3-5 specific, measurable goals for the coming year tied directly to the metrics and examples provided in the evaluation."

## Exercise 5: Development-Focused Evaluation

Create prompts for performance evaluations that emphasize professional development and growth for employees at different career stages:

1. A new employee in their first 90 days

2. An individual contributor with 2-3 years of experience ready for more responsibility

3. A recently promoted first-time manager

4. A mid-career professional whose role is being impacted by technological change

5. A senior leader preparing for executive responsibilities

For each career stage, your prompt should request specific development recommendations appropriate to their experience level and career trajectory.

**Example:**
"Create a growth-oriented performance evaluation for a recently promoted first-time manager who is six months into their new role leading a team of five customer service representatives. This evaluation should serve primarily as a developmental tool rather than just an assessment, with the following components:

1. Transition assessment that evaluates how effectively they've shifted from individual contributor to manager, including:
   - Delegation effectiveness (with specific examples of both successful delegation and instances of unnecessary involvement)
   - Time allocation analysis (percentage breakdown of where they're spending their time vs. recommended allocations)
   - Team member feedback themes (anonymized insights from their direct reports)

2. Management skill evaluation across key areas:
   - Team performance management (how they're tracking, evaluating, and developing their team)
   - Meeting and communication effectiveness (structure, frequency, clarity)
   - Decision-making and problem-solving approach (with specific examples)
   - Relationship building with peers and other departments

3. Comprehensive development plan including:
   - Three highest-priority development areas based on the assessment
   - Specific learning resources tailored to each development area (training, books, mentorship)
   - Structured learning experiences to accelerate growth (projects, stretch assignments, shadowing)
   - Regular feedback mechanisms to evaluate progress
   - Timeline with 30/60/90 day development milestones

4. Strengths to leverage section that identifies 2-3 existing strengths from their individual contributor role that can be reapplied in their management role in new ways.

The evaluation should normalize the challenges of transitioning to management, maintain an encouraging tone while being honest about development needs, and emphasize that this is a learning period rather than expecting mastery at this stage."

## Exercise 6: Multi-Perspective Evaluation Framework

Create a comprehensive prompt for a 360-degree performance evaluation that incorporates feedback from multiple perspectives:

1. Self-assessment
2. Manager evaluation
3. Peer feedback
4. Direct report input (if applicable)
5. Cross-functional stakeholder perspectives

Your prompt should specify how to synthesize these different perspectives into a cohesive evaluation while addressing potential contradictions or biases.

**Example:**
"Create a comprehensive 360-degree performance evaluation framework for a product manager that effectively synthesizes feedback from multiple stakeholders. The evaluation should:

1. Begin with a structured self-assessment section where the product manager evaluates their own performance across key dimensions:
   - Product strategy and roadmap development
   - Execution and delivery management
   - Stakeholder communication and alignment
   - Team leadership and collaboration
   - Technical and market understanding

2. Include a manager evaluation section that assesses the same dimensions but also addresses:
   - Alignment with broader organizational goals
   - Growth in capabilities over the evaluation period
   - Impact on business metrics and outcomes

3. Synthesize peer feedback from:
   - Engineering team members (focusing on technical collaboration and requirement clarity)
   - Design team members (focusing on user advocacy and creative problem-solving)
   - Marketing colleagues (focusing on product positioning and launch coordination)
   - Sales team members (focusing on customer needs representation and sales enablement)

4. Incorporate direct report feedback (if the product manager leads others) regarding:
   - Leadership style and effectiveness
   - Career development support
   - Decision-making approach and inclusivity
   - Feedback and recognition practices

5. Include cross-functional stakeholder perspectives from:
   - Customer-facing roles (support, success, implementation)
   - Executive sponsors or business unit leaders
   - External partners or vendors (if applicable)

The evaluation should:
- Present each perspective clearly while identifying common themes across feedback sources
- Highlight areas where perspectives differ and explore potential reasons for these differences
- Address potential biases in each feedback source (e.g., recency bias, halo effect)
- Provide a balanced synthesis that weighs feedback appropriately based on relevance and reliability
- Conclude with integrated development recommendations that address the most significant themes from across all perspectives

Include guidance on how to present this multi-source feedback constructively, particularly when there are contradictions between how the individual perceives their performance and how others experience it."
