## Common Mistakes and Improvements

### Weak Prompt:

**Problems:**
- No specified HR role
- Vague position type ("sales")
- No required elements specified
- No format guidance
- No inclusion requirements
- No company context

### Improved Prompt:
```
As a talent acquisition specialist, create a detailed job description for a B2B Sales Account Manager position that will attract diverse candidates. Include:

1. A compelling company overview that highlights our collaborative culture and customer-focused approach
2. Specific responsibilities including account management, sales targets, and client relationship building
3. Required qualifications that focus on demonstrable skills and competencies rather than years of experience
4. Preferred qualifications clearly labeled as "nice-to-have"
5. A comprehensive benefits section including salary range ($75K-90K), commission structure, flexible work options, and professional development opportunities

Format with clear section headings and concise bullet points. Use inclusive language throughout, avoiding competitive sports metaphors and militaristic terms. Include a statement that encourages candidates to apply even if they meet only 75% of the qualifications, as research shows this encourages more women and underrepresented groups to apply.
```
