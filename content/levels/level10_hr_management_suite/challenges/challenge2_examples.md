# Performance Evaluation Prompt Examples

## Basic Performance Evaluation Prompts

### Example 1: Simple Performance Review

**Prompt:**
```
As a manager, write a performance review for a team member who has met expectations over the past year. Include their strengths and areas for improvement.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (manager)
- Specifies the context (met expectations)
- Requests specific elements (strengths, areas for improvement)
- Provides timeframe (past year)

### Example 2: Structured Evaluation with Examples

**Prompt:**
```
As an HR professional, create a performance evaluation for a customer service representative that includes:
1. Key achievements from the past six months
2. Areas for development with specific examples
3. Goals for the next review period
4. Overall performance assessment

Focus on observable behaviors rather than personality traits, and provide specific examples for each point of feedback.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies the role (HR professional)
- Defines the position being evaluated (customer service representative)
- Provides a structured format with numbered sections
- Requests specific content elements
- Includes behavior-focused guidance
- Requires specific examples
- Specifies timeframe (past six months)

## Intermediate Performance Evaluation Prompts

### Example 3: Comprehensive Balanced Evaluation

**Prompt:**
```
As a performance management specialist, create a detailed performance evaluation for a mid-level marketing coordinator who has shown strong creative skills but struggles with deadlines. The evaluation should include:

1. Achievements Section:
   - 3-4 specific accomplishments with measurable impact
   - Recognition of strengths demonstrated consistently
   - Examples of contributions to team success

2. Development Opportunities Section:
   - 2-3 specific areas for improvement with observable examples
   - Impact of these development areas on work outcomes
   - Distinction between skill gaps and behavioral patterns

3. Forward-Looking Development Plan:
   - Specific, measurable goals for the next 6 months
   - Learning resources and support recommendations
   - Clear connection between development areas and goals

4. Overall Assessment:
   - Balanced summary of performance
   - Recognition of progress since last review
   - Clear performance trajectory indication

Use constructive language throughout that focuses on growth rather than criticism. For each development area, provide a specific, actionable suggestion. Balance the evaluation with approximately 60% focus on strengths and 40% on development opportunities. Avoid subjective or personality-based assessments by focusing on observable behaviors and outcomes.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (performance management specialist)
- Provides specific context about the employee
- Creates detailed structure with main sections and subsections
- Specifies number of items for key sections
- Requires measurable elements and examples
- Includes forward-looking development focus
- Specifies language approach (constructive, growth-focused)
- Provides specific balance ratio (60/40)
- Includes bias mitigation guidance

### Example 4: Behavior-Based Evaluation

**Prompt:**
```
As an HR director, create a behavior-based performance evaluation for a project manager that focuses exclusively on observable actions and their impacts. The evaluation should:

1. Use the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe 3-4 key performance incidents that represent patterns of behavior
2. For each incident, clearly connect the employee's specific actions to measurable outcomes
3. Identify behavior patterns across different projects and situations
4. Distinguish between behaviors that led to positive outcomes and those that created challenges
5. Recommend specific behavioral adjustments that would improve effectiveness
6. Create development goals framed as behavior changes rather than skill acquisition

Avoid all subjective language, personality assessments, or assumptions about intent. Focus only on what was directly observable and the resulting impact. Include both positive behaviors to continue and behaviors to modify, maintaining a 2:1 ratio of positive to constructive feedback. For each behavior to modify, suggest a specific alternative behavior that would lead to better outcomes.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies senior role (HR director)
- Requests specific approach (behavior-based, STAR format)
- Focuses on observable actions and impacts
- Requires pattern identification across situations
- Specifies connection between behaviors and outcomes
- Frames development as behavior change
- Includes specific ratio guidance (2:1)
- Requires alternative behavior suggestions
- Explicitly prohibits subjective elements

## Advanced Performance Evaluation Prompts

### Example 5: Growth-Trajectory Evaluation

**Prompt:**
```
As a talent development specialist, create a growth-trajectory performance evaluation for a software developer who joined 18 months ago as a junior and has been progressing toward a mid-level role. This evaluation should:

1. Developmental Timeline Analysis:
   - Map skill development across 3-4 key technical competencies over time
   - Identify acceleration points and plateaus in their learning curve
   - Compare actual growth trajectory against expected progression

2. Response to Previous Development Plans:
   - Assess implementation of previous review recommendations
   - Evaluate adaptation to feedback and coaching
   - Measure progress against previously set goals

3. Current Performance Assessment:
   - Evaluate current performance against mid-level developer standards
   - Identify remaining gaps between current and target performance
   - Distinguish between technical skill gaps and professional behavior gaps

4. Personalized Growth Projection:
   - Create a customized development roadmap for the next 12 months
   - Identify optimal learning approaches based on demonstrated learning patterns
   - Set milestone expectations with specific timeframes

5. Support and Resources Plan:
   - Recommend specific mentoring or coaching relationships
   - Identify targeted learning resources matched to learning style
   - Suggest stretch assignments aligned with growth goals

Use evidence-based assessment throughout, citing specific projects, code reviews, and observable behaviors. Avoid comparative language to other team members, focusing instead on objective role standards and the employee's own growth pattern. Maintain a developmental rather than evaluative tone, emphasizing continuous growth rather than fixed assessment.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies highly specialized role (talent development specialist)
- Provides detailed employee context and history
- Focuses on growth trajectory rather than static evaluation
- Creates comprehensive structure with developmental focus
- Requires evidence-based assessment
- Includes personalized elements (learning patterns, style)
- Specifies tone (developmental vs. evaluative)
- Avoids potentially biased comparative assessment

### Example 6: Strength-Based Performance Evaluation

**Prompt:**
```
As a strengths-based performance coach, create a performance evaluation for a team leader that primarily focuses on identifying and leveraging their unique strengths while addressing only critical limitations. The evaluation should:

1. Strengths Identification and Analysis:
   - Identify 4-5 distinctive strengths demonstrated through observable behaviors
   - Analyze the impact of each strength on team performance and outcomes
   - Evaluate the consistency of strength application across different situations
   - Identify underutilized strengths with high potential impact

2. Strength Interaction Patterns:
   - Analyze how different strengths complement or occasionally conflict with each other
   - Identify strength combinations that create unique value
   - Recognize when overreliance on certain strengths might overshadow others

3. Strategic Strength Deployment:
   - Recommend optimal contexts for applying each key strength
   - Suggest how to adapt strength expression for different stakeholders
   - Identify opportunities to mentor others in areas of strength

4. Complementary Skill Development:
   - Identify 1-2 skill gaps that, if addressed, would significantly amplify existing strengths
   - Recommend development approaches that build on strengths while addressing these gaps
   - Create strength-based learning strategies that leverage natural talents

5. Limiting Factors (Brief):
   - Identify only those 1-2 limitations that significantly constrain effectiveness
   - Frame limitations as "strength overextensions" where possible
   - Suggest mitigation strategies that work around rather than directly "fix" limitations

Use specific examples throughout that demonstrate each strength in action. Maintain a ratio of at least 80% strength focus to 20% limitation focus. Avoid deficit-based language, instead framing all development in terms of growth and amplification rather than fixing or correcting. For each strength, provide at least one specific suggestion for how it could be leveraged in new or expanded ways.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies specialized role (strengths-based performance coach)
- Requests specific approach (strengths-based)
- Creates comprehensive structure focused on strengths
- Includes sophisticated elements (strength interactions, strategic deployment)
- Limits focus on weaknesses (only 1-2 critical limitations)
- Reframes limitations positively (strength overextensions)
- Specifies ratio (80/20)
- Requires specific examples throughout
- Includes forward-looking application suggestions

## Common Mistakes and Improvements

### Weak Prompt:
```
Write a performance review for an employee.
```

**Problems:**
- No specified role
- No context about the employee
- No required elements specified
- No guidance on approach or tone
- No bias mitigation requirements
- No structure specified

### Improved Prompt:
```
As an HR manager, create a balanced performance evaluation for a customer support team member who has been with the company for one year. Include:

1. 3-4 specific achievements with measurable impact and examples
2. 2-3 development areas with observable behaviors rather than personality traits
3. Specific, actionable goals for the next six months
4. An overall assessment that acknowledges both strengths and growth areas

Use constructive language that focuses on development rather than criticism. For each area of improvement, provide a specific suggestion for how to develop that skill. Include only behaviors you have directly observed or that have been consistently reported by multiple reliable sources. Avoid recency bias by considering performance across the entire review period, not just recent events.
```

**Improvements:**
- Added specific role (HR manager)
- Added employee context (customer support, one year tenure)
- Listed specific sections with number of items
- Required measurable impacts and examples
- Specified constructive language approach
- Added bias mitigation (observable behaviors, avoiding recency bias)
- Required actionable development suggestions
- Balanced structure (more achievements than development areas)
