# Workplace Communication Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Workplace Communication Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following workplace communication prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Write an email to my team."

2. "Draft a company-wide email announcing a significant organizational restructuring that will result in some department consolidations and role changes. The email should come from the CEO and accomplish the following: 1) Clearly explain the business reasons driving the restructuring (market changes and strategic realignment), 2) Outline the specific changes at a department level without detailing individual impacts, 3) Address likely concerns about job security with appropriate transparency, 4) Establish a timeline for the changes and next steps for communication, 5) Convey confidence in the company's future while acknowledging the challenges of change. The tone should be direct and honest while remaining sensitive to the anxiety this news may cause."

3. "Help me write a message about the project delay."

4. "Create a communication to resolve a conflict between two team members who disagree on the approach to an important client project. The message should be written from the perspective of their manager and accomplish the following: 1) Acknowledge both perspectives without taking sides, 2) Refocus the discussion on shared objectives and client needs, 3) Propose a specific process for reaching a collaborative solution, 4) Set clear expectations for professional communication going forward, 5) Offer individual support while emphasizing team accountability. The tone should be firm but supportive, reinforcing team values while addressing the specific behaviors that need to change."

5. "Write something for the company newsletter."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts provide specific context and communication objectives?
- Which prompts address tone and emotional considerations?
- Which prompts consider the audience and their potential reactions?
- How do the detailed prompts guide more effective workplace communications?

## Exercise 2: Communication Context Development

Enhance the following basic workplace communication prompts by adding specific context, communication objectives, audience considerations, and tone requirements:

1. "Write an announcement about a new company policy."

2. "Draft talking points for a team meeting."

3. "Create a message declining a vendor proposal."

4. "Write a response to a customer complaint."

5. "Develop content for employee onboarding."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Write an email about the office move."
- Enhanced: "Draft an email to all 120 employees about our upcoming office relocation from downtown to the suburban tech park, scheduled to occur in 8 weeks. The email should come from the Facilities Director and accomplish the following objectives: 1) Announce the final move date and high-level timeline, 2) Explain the practical improvements the new location offers (more meeting rooms, better parking, upgraded technology), 3) Address anticipated concerns about the longer commute for downtown residents, 4) Outline the support resources available to help with the transition (relocation stipend, commuter benefits, flexible work options), 5) Provide a clear FAQ section addressing common questions, and 6) Preview the schedule of upcoming detailed communications. The tone should be positive but practical, acknowledging the disruption while focusing on the benefits and support available."

## Exercise 3: Audience-Tailored Communication

For each of the following workplace scenarios, create a prompt that requests communication tailored to specific audiences:

1. Announcing a major system change to both technical and non-technical employees

2. Explaining a policy update to managers and individual contributors

3. Communicating organizational changes to internal employees and external stakeholders

4. Sharing project status updates with executive leadership and working team members

5. Delivering feedback to high-performing and struggling team members

**Example:**
"Create two versions of a communication announcing the implementation of a new customer relationship management (CRM) system - one tailored for the sales team and another for the customer support team.

For the sales team version:
- Focus on how the new CRM will improve lead tracking, opportunity management, and sales forecasting
- Address concerns about the learning curve and potential impact on current deals in the pipeline
- Emphasize features that will help increase conversion rates and reduce administrative work
- Include specific examples of how the system will streamline their current pain points in the sales process
- Outline the specialized training and resources available specifically for sales functions

For the customer support team version:
- Highlight how the system will provide a comprehensive view of customer history and interactions
- Focus on features that improve case management, response time, and issue resolution
- Address concerns about migrating existing customer data and maintaining service levels during transition
- Include specific examples of how the system will improve their ability to support customers effectively
- Detail the specialized training and resources focused on customer support functions

Both communications should:
- Begin with the same brief overview of why the company is implementing the new system
- Maintain a consistent timeline and implementation milestones
- Share the same key contacts for questions and support
- Convey enthusiasm while acknowledging the challenges of system transitions
- End with clear next steps specific to each department's role in the implementation"

## Exercise 4: Tone and Emotional Intelligence

Create prompts for workplace communications that require specific tones and emotional intelligence for sensitive situations:

1. Announcing layoffs or significant workforce reductions

2. Addressing a public relations crisis or company mistake

3. Responding to employee concerns about workplace conditions

4. Communicating performance concerns to a valuable but challenging employee

5. Delivering disappointing news about company performance or benefits changes

**Example:**
"Draft a communication from the CEO to all employees addressing recent media allegations about unethical business practices at our company. The situation involves claims from a former employee about misleading financial reporting, which we have evidence are largely inaccurate but contain some elements that warrant internal review.

The communication should:
1. Acknowledge the allegations directly without being defensive or dismissive
2. Clearly state our company's ethical standards and commitment to integrity
3. Outline the specific steps being taken to investigate the claims thoroughly
4. Provide appropriate context without undermining or criticizing the former employee
5. Address employee concerns about company stability and reputation
6. Give clear guidance on how employees should respond to questions from clients, friends, or media

The tone should balance several elements:
- Confidence in our ethical standards without appearing arrogant
- Appropriate concern without creating unnecessary alarm
- Transparency about the process without oversharing details that could compromise the investigation
- Empathy for how this situation affects employees while maintaining leadership authority

The communication should avoid:
- Legal jargon or overly formal corporate language
- Promises about outcomes that cannot be guaranteed
- Deflecting responsibility or blaming others
- Minimizing legitimate concerns

Include guidance for managers on how to discuss this sensitively with their teams and handle follow-up questions."

## Exercise 5: Communication Format and Structure

Create prompts for workplace communications that request specific formats and structures appropriate to different communication needs:

1. A structured announcement of a major company initiative

2. A persuasive proposal for a new program or resource

3. A comprehensive change management communication plan

4. A conflict resolution framework for team disagreements

5. A constructive feedback template for regular performance conversations

**Example:**
"Create a structured change management communication plan template for rolling out a significant new workflow process that will affect multiple departments. The communication plan should include:

1. Executive Summary section:
   - One-paragraph overview of the change and its strategic importance
   - Key timeline milestones
   - Success metrics for the communication plan itself

2. Stakeholder Analysis section with a table format including:
   - Stakeholder group identification
   - Current state assessment (knowledge, attitude, concerns)
   - Desired future state for each group
   - Key messages needed to bridge the gap
   - Preferred communication channels for each group

3. Core Messaging Framework with:
   - Primary rationale: Why this change is happening (business case)
   - Impact statement: How it affects different roles and processes
   - Benefits articulation: Specific improvements for various stakeholders
   - Timeline and expectations: What happens when and what people need to do
   - Support resources: Where to get help and information

4. Communication Sequence with specific touchpoints:
   - Awareness phase communications (timing, format, sender, audience, purpose)
   - Understanding phase communications
   - Acceptance phase communications
   - Commitment phase communications
   - Reinforcement phase communications

5. Feedback Mechanisms section detailing:
   - Methods for collecting questions and concerns
   - Process for addressing common issues
   - Approach for measuring communication effectiveness
   - Adaptation strategy for messaging based on feedback

The template should be designed for easy customization, with placeholders for specific details and guidance notes for effective implementation. Include recommendations for communication frequency and spacing to avoid information overload while maintaining momentum."

## Exercise 6: Multi-Channel Communication Strategy

Create a comprehensive prompt for developing an integrated multi-channel communication strategy for a significant workplace initiative or change:

1. Email/written communications
2. In-person/virtual meetings
3. Visual/presentation materials
4. Digital/collaborative platforms
5. Manager cascades/one-on-one conversations

Your prompt should specify how these different channels work together to reinforce key messages while addressing different communication preferences and needs.

**Example:**
"Develop a comprehensive multi-channel communication strategy for announcing and implementing a new company-wide flexible work policy that allows for hybrid remote/office arrangements based on role requirements and team coordination. The strategy should integrate the following channels effectively:

1. Written Communications:
   - Executive announcement email introducing the policy (specify tone, length, key components)
   - Detailed policy document (outline structure, level of detail, accessibility considerations)
   - FAQ resource (identify 10-15 most critical questions to address)
   - Regular implementation updates (frequency, format, content focus)
   - Digital handbook for ongoing reference (organization, searchability features)

2. Live Session Components:
   - Company-wide virtual town hall (agenda, presentation/discussion balance, technology needs)
   - Department-specific meetings (customization approach, leader talking points)
   - Manager training sessions (content focus, interactive elements)
   - Open forum Q&A opportunities (format, moderation approach, psychological safety considerations)
   - Individual consultation availability (scheduling, structure, documentation)

3. Visual and Multimedia Elements:
   - Infographic summarizing key policy points (content prioritization, design principles)
   - Short video messages from leadership (length, style, production considerations)
   - Decision-tree tools for determining individual arrangements (format, interactivity)
   - Before/after workflow visualizations (key processes to illustrate, level of detail)
   - Visual workplace configuration guides (elements to include, customization by location)

4. Digital Platform Integration:
   - Intranet resource hub (organization, search functionality, updates approach)
   - Collaboration tool announcements and resources (platform-specific formatting)
   - Mobile accessibility considerations (content adaptation for small screens)
   - Interactive scheduling and coordination tools (functionality requirements)
   - Feedback collection mechanisms (format, anonymity options, reporting process)

5. Manager Enablement Components:
   - Team discussion guide (structure, timing recommendations, difficult question preparation)
   - Individual conversation framework (consistency elements, customization areas)
   - Implementation tracking tools (metrics, reporting process, intervention triggers)
   - Peer support mechanisms for managers (format, facilitation approach)
   - Escalation path for complex situations (criteria, process, resources)

For each channel component, specify:
- Timing in the overall sequence
- Primary responsibility for creation and delivery
- Success metrics for that specific component
- Integration points with other channels to reinforce messages
- Accessibility considerations to ensure all employees can engage regardless of location, language, or ability

The strategy should also include an approach for gathering and incorporating feedback throughout implementation, adapting communications based on emerging needs, and transitioning from initial announcement to sustained practice."
