# Recruitment Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Recruitment Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following recruitment prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Write a job posting for a software engineer."

2. "As an HR Director, create a comprehensive job description for a Product Manager position that includes: core responsibilities focused on product strategy and execution, required qualifications (5+ years product experience, data-driven decision making, cross-functional leadership), and desired skills (experience in SaaS products, UX knowledge). Format with clear sections including company introduction, role overview, responsibilities, qualifications, benefits, and DEI statement. Use inclusive language throughout, avoiding terms that might discourage diverse candidates, and focus on performance outcomes rather than years of experience where possible."

3. "Create a job ad for a rockstar developer who can crush code and work insane hours to help our fast-paced startup dominate the market."

4. "As a Talent Acquisition Specialist for a healthcare organization, develop a job description for a Clinical Research Coordinator that clearly outlines the role's purpose in supporting patient-centered research, details specific responsibilities (protocol implementation, participant recruitment, data collection, regulatory compliance), specifies required qualifications (clinical background, research ethics training, data management experience) and presents them in a structured format with clear headings. Use inclusive, accessible language that avoids healthcare jargon where possible and emphasizes the organization's commitment to work-life balance and professional development."

5. "Need a job description for a marketing person ASAP."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts have clear position specifications?
- Which prompts provide inclusive language guidance?
- Which prompts include format and structure requirements?
- How would you improve the weaker prompts?

## Exercise 2: Position Specification Enhancement

Enhance the following basic job description prompts by adding detailed position specifications:

1. "Create a job posting for a customer service representative."
2. "Write a job description for a project manager."
3. "Develop a job ad for a data analyst."
4. "Create a posting for a sales position."
5. "Write a job description for a graphic designer."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Create a job description for an accountant."
- Enhanced: "Create a job description for a Senior Financial Accountant who will be responsible for managing month-end closing processes, preparing financial statements, ensuring regulatory compliance, and supporting the annual audit process. The role requires expertise in GAAP, experience with ERP systems (preferably SAP), and the ability to mentor junior team members. The position sits within a 10-person finance team supporting a mid-sized manufacturing company with international operations."

## Exercise 3: Inclusive Language Specification

For each of the following roles, create a prompt that includes comprehensive inclusive language guidance:

1. A leadership position
2. A technical role in engineering
3. A creative position
4. A customer-facing role
5. An operations position

Your prompts should specify:
- Gender-neutral language requirements
- Accessibility considerations
- Cultural inclusivity guidelines
- Age-neutral phrasing
- Bias mitigation strategies

## Exercise 4: Format and Structure Requirements

Create recruitment prompts that include explicit format and structure requirements for each of the following scenarios:

1. A job description for a corporate website
2. A job posting for a social media platform
3. A detailed position description for internal mobility
4. A concise job ad for a job board
5. A comprehensive role description for executive search

For each prompt, include requirements for:
- Section organization
- Content hierarchy
- Visual presentation elements
- Length and level of detail
- Tone and style guidance

## Exercise 5: Qualification Framing Guidance

For each of the following roles, create a prompt that provides guidance on effectively framing qualifications:

1. An entry-level position suitable for recent graduates
2. A specialized technical role requiring specific expertise
3. A management position requiring leadership experience
4. A creative role balancing technical skills and artistic ability
5. A customer success position balancing soft and technical skills

Your prompts should specify:
- How to distinguish between required and preferred qualifications
- How to focus on capabilities rather than credentials
- How to balance specificity with accessibility
- How to present experience requirements inclusively
- How to highlight growth potential

## Challenge Exercise: Comprehensive Recruitment Framework

Create a comprehensive recruitment prompt framework that can be adapted for different positions and organizational contexts. Your framework should include sections for:

1. Position specification (purpose, responsibilities, qualifications, team context)
2. Inclusive language guidance (gender-neutral, accessible, culturally inclusive)
3. Format and structure requirements (organization, hierarchy, presentation)
4. Qualification framing (required vs. preferred, capabilities vs. credentials)
5. Company culture representation (values, work environment, benefits)
6. Diversity and inclusion emphasis (commitment statements, support systems)

Use your framework to create detailed prompts for:
1. A technical role in a startup environment
2. A management position in a traditional corporate setting
3. A specialized role in a mission-driven organization

For each prompt, explain how your framework ensures the job description will be effective, inclusive, and aligned with organizational goals.
