# Negative Constraints in Action: Real-World Examples

## Example 1: Technical Writing with Negative Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**

```text
Explain how blockchain technology works.
```

**Result:** A potentially complex, technical explanation that might overwhelm non-technical readers.

**Negative Constraint Prompt:**

```text
Explain how blockchain technology works with these constraints:
- Do not use technical jargon without immediately providing a simple definition
- Avoid mathematical explanations or formulas entirely
- Don't discuss cryptocurrency price speculation or investment advice
- Don't delve into the details of specific consensus algorithms
- Refrain from using programming code examples
- Don't make comparisons to complex distributed systems that would require additional explanation
```

**Result:** A clear, accessible explanation focused on the core concepts without overwhelming technical details or tangential topics that might confuse a general audience.

## Example 2: Business Strategy with Negative Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**

```text
Provide strategies for improving our customer service.
```

**Result:** Generic advice that might include impractical or irrelevant suggestions.

**Negative Constraint Prompt:**

```text

```

**Result:** Focused, practical customer service improvements that fit within the company's size, budget, and timeline constraints.

## Example 3: Educational Content with Negative Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**

```text

```

**Result:** An explanation that might use inappropriate language, be too complex, or include politically charged framing.

**Negative Constraint Prompt:**

```text
Create an educational explanation of climate change for middle school students (ages 11-13) with these constraints:
- Don't use scientific terminology without simple explanations
- Avoid political framing or partisan perspectives
- Don't include detailed statistical data that would be difficult to comprehend
- Refrain from using alarming or fear-inducing language
- Don't oversimplify to the point of scientific inaccuracy
- Avoid focusing on controversial aspects of climate policy
- Don't present the topic in a way that could make students feel hopeless

- Avoid explicit violence or graphic crime scenes
- Don't reveal the culprit until the final paragraph
- Refrain from using coincidences or deus ex machina to solve the mystery
- Don't rely on high-tech forensic methods that would require technical explanations

## Example 5: Product Review with Negative Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**

```text

```

**Result:** A balanced, informative review that evaluates the product on its own merits while considering various user needs and comparing it to the broader smartphone market.

## Example 6: Health Information with Negative Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**

```text
Explain the benefits of meditation.
```

**Result:** Potentially overstated claims or a one-sided view that ignores limitations.

- Don't make claims about medical benefits without noting they are supported by research
- Avoid language suggesting meditation can replace conventional medical treatments
- Don't present meditation as equally beneficial for everyone regardless of condition
- Refrain from using spiritual or religious framing unless specifically discussing those traditions
- Don't ignore potential challenges or limitations for beginners
- Avoid suggesting specific meditation durations or frequencies without noting individual variation
```

**Result:** A balanced, evidence-based explanation of meditation benefits that acknowledges limitations and avoids overpromising results.

## Example 7: Professional Email with Negative Constraints

**Basic Prompt:**

```text
Write an email requesting a deadline extension for a project.

**Result:** A professional, assertive email that clearly states the request while maintaining a strong professional relationship and setting clear expectations.

## The Negative Constraint Framework

When crafting negative constraints, consider these categories:

1. **Content Exclusions**
   - What topics should be avoided?
   - What information would be irrelevant or distracting?
   - What content might be inappropriate for the audience?

2. **Approach Limitations**
   - What methods or perspectives should be avoided?
   - What tones or styles would be inappropriate?
   - What assumptions should not be made?

3. **Format Restrictions**
   - What structural elements would be unhelpful?
   - What presentation styles should be avoided?
   - What length or complexity constraints are needed?

4. **Common Pitfalls to Prevent**
   - What typical mistakes occur in this type of content?
   - What biases or imbalances should be avoided?
   - What oversimplifications would be problematic?

Remember, effective negative constraints aren't about making the task harder—they're about eliminating unhelpful or irrelevant elements from the response. The right constraints can dramatically improve the usefulness of AI outputs by ensuring they avoid common problems and stay focused on what's truly important for your specific needs.
