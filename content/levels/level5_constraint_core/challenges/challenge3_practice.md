# Constraint Synthesis Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Constraint Type Identification

Analyze the following prompts and identify the different types of constraints used (negative constraints, creative constraints, structural constraints, etc.):

1. "Design a logo for a tech startup, avoiding clichéd symbols like gears or circuit boards, using only geometric shapes, with a maximum of two colors plus white, and ensuring it works in both color and grayscale formats."

2. "Write a short story about friendship."

3. "Create a marketing campaign for a sustainable fashion brand that doesn't rely on environmental guilt or greenwashing tactics, uses storytelling focused on product longevity rather than trends, incorporates user-generated content from actual customers, and can be executed across three different channels with a consistent message."

4. "Suggest some dinner recipes."

5. "Develop a fitness routine for beginners."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts combine multiple types of constraints effectively?
- How do negative constraints (what to avoid) work together with positive constraints (what to include)?
- Which prompts would likely produce the most specific and tailored responses?

## Exercise 2: Constraint Synthesis

For each of the following basic prompts, enhance them by adding a synthesis of at least two different types of constraints:

1. "Write a poem about nature."

2. "Design a homepage for a website."

3. "Create a presentation about leadership."

4. "Develop a product concept for a smart home device."

5. "Plan a marketing strategy for a new app."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Create a logo for a restaurant."
- With synthesized constraints: "Create a logo for a farm-to-table restaurant that avoids rustic clichés like barn symbols or wheat stalks (negative constraint), uses a color palette inspired by seasonal vegetables (creative constraint), maintains perfect legibility at sizes as small as 1 inch square (technical constraint), and incorporates subtle references to the local landscape without using literal imagery (thematic constraint)."

## Exercise 3: Negative-Creative Constraint Pairing

For each of the following creative tasks, create a prompt that specifically pairs negative constraints (what to avoid) with creative constraints (boundaries that shape creation):

1. Writing a company mission statement

2. Designing a children's toy

3. Creating a social media campaign

4. Developing a user interface for an app

5. Planning an educational workshop

**Example:**
"Write a company mission statement for a cybersecurity firm that avoids fear-based messaging and technical jargon (negative constraints), while working within a 25-word limit, using active voice throughout, and incorporating a subtle metaphor related to protection without using shield imagery (creative constraints)."

## Exercise 4: Multi-Dimensional Constraint Matrix

Create comprehensive prompts for the following creative tasks that include constraints across at least four different dimensions:

1. Writing a short story

2. Designing a product package

3. Creating a video advertisement

4. Developing a board game concept

5. Planning a public space

For each task, include constraints related to content, structure, style, and technical execution.

**Example:**
"Design a product package for an premium organic tea brand with the following constraints:
- Content constraints: Avoid health claims and buzzwords like 'detox' or 'cleanse'; focus on origin story and flavor profile instead of benefits
- Structural constraints: Design must use a hexagonal prism shape; incorporate a reusable/functional element after the product is consumed
- Style constraints: Use a color palette derived from the actual tea ingredients; typography limited to a single serif font family with maximum of three weights
- Technical constraints: Design must be printable using only two specialty inks plus black; all text must remain legible at 8pt size; package must be manufacturable using sustainable materials with no plastic components"

## Exercise 5: Constraint Balance Challenge

The following prompts contain imbalanced constraints that might be too restrictive or not restrictive enough. Rewrite them to create a better balance:

1. "Write a business email that doesn't use any business jargon, corporate speak, or formal language, is written in a casual, friendly tone, includes at least one joke, and is no longer than three sentences."

2. "Design a logo that uses colors."

3. "Create a 30-minute workout routine that doesn't include any exercises that put strain on the knees or require equipment, can be done in a small space, is suitable for beginners, incorporates strength, cardio and flexibility, targets all major muscle groups, and burns at least 400 calories."

4. "Write a social media post about our new product."

5. "Design a website that doesn't look like other websites in our industry, uses innovative navigation, incorporates cutting-edge design trends, appeals to both young and older demographics, works perfectly on all devices, and can be built within our limited budget and timeline."

**Example balanced rewrite:**
- Imbalanced: "Create a presentation that doesn't use bullet points, includes at least 50 slides, uses only images with no text, and needs to cover our entire quarterly business strategy in detail."
- Balanced: "Create a presentation about our quarterly business strategy that uses visual storytelling instead of traditional bullet points (negative constraint), limits text to 10-15 words per slide (structural constraint), incorporates data visualization for key metrics (content constraint), and uses a consistent visual metaphor throughout to tie concepts together (creative constraint)."

## Exercise 6: Constraint Synthesis for Problem-Solving

For each of the following problem scenarios, create a prompt with synthesized constraints that would guide effective solutions:

1. A team that generates too many ideas but struggles to execute them

2. A writer who creates overly complex, jargon-filled content

3. A design team that produces visually beautiful work that doesn't meet user needs

4. A product development process that takes too long and misses market opportunities

5. A marketing approach that attracts initial interest but fails to convert to sales

**Example:**
"Develop a project prioritization framework for our team that excludes subjective criteria like 'personal interest' or 'gut feeling' (negative constraint), requires each project to be evaluated on exactly three dimensions: customer impact, resource requirement, and strategic alignment (structural constraint), uses a simple 1-5 scoring system for each dimension (technical constraint), and can be completed for a new idea in under 10 minutes (practical constraint)."
