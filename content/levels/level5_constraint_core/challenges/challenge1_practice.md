# Negative Constraints Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Constraint Analysis

Analyze the following prompts and identify the negative constraints being used:

1. "Explain how a car engine works without using technical jargon or engineering terminology."
2. "Write a summary of World War II that doesn't focus on the United States' involvement."
3. "Provide cooking instructions for pasta that don't require specialized equipment."
4. "Give career advice for recent graduates without mentioning networking or social media."
5. "Describe the water cycle in a way that a 6-year-old would understand, without oversimplifying the core scientific concepts."

**Questions to consider:**
- What is being explicitly excluded in each prompt?
- How do these constraints help focus or improve the potential response?
- What implicit guidance do these negative constraints provide?

## Exercise 2: Adding Negative Constraints

Enhance the following basic prompts by adding effective negative constraints:

1. "Explain climate change."
2. "Provide tips for public speaking."
3. "Describe the benefits of meditation."
4. "Write a character description for a novel."
5. "Give advice on learning a new language."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Explain artificial intelligence."
- Enhanced: "Explain artificial intelligence without using technical jargon, without focusing on sci-fi scenarios, and without diving into complex mathematical concepts."

## Exercise 3: Constraint Categories

For each of the following prompts, add one constraint from each category:
- Content exclusion (topics or information to avoid)
- Approach exclusion (methods or styles to avoid)
- Format exclusion (structures or presentations to avoid)

1. "Write a guide to personal finance."
2. "Create a marketing strategy for a new smartphone."
3. "Explain the theory of evolution."
4. "Describe effective leadership qualities."
5. "Provide an analysis of a famous painting."

## Exercise 4: Balancing Constraints and Requirements

Create prompts that effectively balance positive requirements with negative constraints for each of the following scenarios:

1. You need an explanation of a complex topic for beginners.
2. You want creative writing that follows certain stylistic guidelines.
3. You need technical instructions that remain accessible.
4. You want advice that avoids common clichés.
5. You need historical information that maintains a specific focus.

For each prompt, include at least two positive requirements (what to include) and two negative constraints (what to avoid).

## Exercise 5: Constraint Precision

Rewrite the following vague constraints to make them more precise and effective:

1. "Don't make it too complicated."
2. "Don't include boring parts."
3. "Don't use big words."
4. "Don't make it too long."
5. "Don't include stuff everyone already knows."

**Example improvement:**
- Vague: "Don't be too technical."
- Precise: "Avoid specialized terminology, mathematical formulas, and coding syntax. When technical concepts must be included, explain them using everyday analogies."

## Challenge Exercise: Strategic Constraint Design

For each of the following complex scenarios, design a prompt with a strategic set of negative constraints that work together to guide the AI toward an optimal response:

1. You need a comprehensive explanation of a controversial political issue that remains balanced and factual.
2. You want creative fiction writing that avoids common tropes and clichés in the genre.
3. You need technical documentation that's accessible to non-technical users without losing accuracy.
4. You want advice on a sensitive personal topic that avoids both judgment and potentially harmful suggestions.
5. You need to explain a complex scientific concept to young students without oversimplification.

For each prompt, include 3-5 carefully crafted negative constraints and explain how they work together to achieve your communication goal.
