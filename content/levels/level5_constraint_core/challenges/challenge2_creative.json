  "successMessage": "As you instruct the energy field to create a pattern using only geometric shapes, limited to a blue and gold color palette, and following the rule of symmetry across both axes, the swirling energy coalesces into a beautiful mandala-like formation that reveals a hidden pathway.",
  "feedback": {
    "noConstraints": "Constraint Error: Your command doesn't specify creative constraints. Try setting specific limitations or boundaries for the creation.",
    "vagueConstraints": "Constraint Detail Error: Your constraints are too vague. Try more specific creative limitations such as style, elements, rules, or parameters.",
    "wrongAction": "Action Error: '{action}' is not the appropriate way to interact with the energy field. Try asking it to create or form something with specific constraints.",
    "noTarget": "Target Error: What do you want to {action}? Specify what should be created or shaped in the energy field.",
    "wrongTarget": "Target Error: There is no '{target}' here. The energy field is the focal point of this chamber.",
    "tooGeneric": "Specificity Required: Your command is too generic. The energy field requires specific creative constraints to function properly."
