# Creative Constraints Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Creative Constraint Analysis

Analyze the following prompts and identify which ones effectively use creative constraints:

1. "Write a story about a journey."

2. "Write a 500-word story about an unexpected journey that takes place entirely in one room, uses only dialogue between two characters, and never explicitly states the reason for the journey. The story should end with the same sentence it begins with."

3. "Design a logo for a coffee shop."

4. "Design a logo for a specialty coffee shop called 'Brew Haven' using only three colors (no black or white), incorporating a nautical element without using obvious symbols like anchors or ships, and ensuring the design works equally well in circular and square formats."

5. "Create a recipe for dinner."

**Questions to consider:**
- How do the creative constraints shape the expected output?
- Which constraints focus on form versus content?
- How might the constraints lead to more innovative or unexpected results?

## Exercise 2: Constraint Categories

For each of the following creative tasks, add three different types of constraints (structural, thematic, stylistic, technical, etc.):

1. Writing a poem

2. Designing a website homepage

3. Creating a presentation

4. Developing a product concept

5. Planning an event

**Example for writing a poem:**
- Structural constraint: "The poem must be exactly 14 lines, with each line containing exactly 7 syllables."
- Thematic constraint: "The poem must explore the concept of transformation without ever using the words 'change,' 'transform,' or their synonyms."
- Stylistic constraint: "The poem must use only concrete imagery (no abstract concepts) and each stanza must begin with a color word."

## Exercise 3: Constraint-Driven Innovation

For each of the following conventional tasks, add creative constraints that would force innovation:

1. Writing a business email

2. Creating a social media post

3. Designing a product package

4. Writing installation instructions

5. Creating a personal introduction

**Example:**
- Conventional: "Write a business email announcing a new product launch."
- With innovative constraints: "Write a business email announcing a new product launch using exactly 10 sentences, where each sentence starts with a consecutive letter of the alphabet (first sentence starts with A, second with B, etc.), without explicitly naming the product until the final sentence, and incorporating a subtle nautical metaphor throughout."

## Exercise 4: Constraint Combinations

Create prompts that combine multiple constraints from different categories for the following creative tasks:

1. Writing a short story

2. Designing a poster

3. Creating a video concept

4. Developing a game mechanic

5. Planning a presentation structure

For each task, include at least one constraint from each of these categories: structural, content, stylistic, and technical.

**Example:**
"Create a video concept for a product tutorial that: 1) Uses exactly 5 scenes of equal length (structural), 2) Never shows the product directly but only its effects (content), 3) Uses a film noir visual aesthetic with high contrast lighting (stylistic), and 4) Can be understood completely without audio (technical)."

## Exercise 5: Constraint Levels

For each of the following creative tasks, create three different prompts with increasing levels of constraint (minimal, moderate, and highly constrained):

1. Creating a character description

2. Designing a logo

3. Writing a marketing tagline

4. Creating a data visualization

5. Developing a user interface

**Example for character description:**
- Minimal constraints: "Create a character description for a protagonist in a fantasy story, including their appearance, personality, and background."
- Moderate constraints: "Create a character description for a protagonist in a fantasy story who is not human, has a physical disability that affects their daily life, and has a conflicted relationship with their extraordinary abilities. Include details about appearance, personality traits, and a defining childhood experience."
- Highly constrained: "Create a character description for a protagonist in a low-magic fantasy setting who belongs to a species that communicates primarily through color changes rather than speech, has lost the use of their dominant appendage, and possesses a rare ability that their culture views as a curse rather than a gift. The description must be exactly 250 words, structured in three paragraphs (physical, psychological, societal), use no more than two adjectives per sentence, and never explicitly state the character's emotional state but instead reveal it through described behaviors and choices."

## Exercise 6: Productive Limitation Challenge

For each of the following scenarios, create a prompt with constraints that would actually make the task easier or more focused rather than more difficult:

1. Writing for someone experiencing writer's block

2. Designing for a team that can't agree on direction

3. Creating content for a very broad or undefined audience

4. Solving a problem with too many possible solutions

5. Explaining a complex concept to beginners

**Example:**
"For someone experiencing writer's block on their novel, write the opening paragraph of the next chapter following these constraints: 1) Focus only on describing a single sensory experience of the main character, 2) Use no more than 100 words, 3) Include exactly one line of internal thought, and 4) End with an incomplete action that naturally leads to what happens next."
