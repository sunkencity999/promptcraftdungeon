# Insights Extraction Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Insights Extraction Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following insights extraction prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Tell me what the data shows."

2. "As a business intelligence analyst, extract key insights from our quarterly sales data that can inform our regional expansion strategy. Identify patterns in high-performing markets, customer segments with growth potential, and product categories showing momentum. For each insight, provide supporting data points, business implications, and specific recommendations for our expansion plan. Prioritize insights based on potential revenue impact and implementation feasibility, and organize them into strategic (long-term) and tactical (immediate) categories."

3. "Find some interesting patterns in our customer data."

4. "As a retail analytics specialist, analyze our store performance data to extract actionable insights about the factors driving sales variations across locations. Identify the relationship between store attributes (size, layout, staffing, location type) and performance metrics, uncover successful merchandising strategies from top-performing stores, and pinpoint operational inefficiencies in underperforming locations. For each key insight, provide: (1) A clear statement of the finding with supporting evidence, (2) Quantification of potential business impact, (3) Specific recommendations with implementation steps, and (4) Success metrics to track effectiveness. Organize insights by implementation timeframe (immediate, short-term, long-term) and resource requirements."

5. "Summarize what the marketing campaign results tell us."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts have clear analytical objectives?
- Which prompts specify how insights should be structured and presented?
- Which prompts include prioritization criteria?
- Which prompts connect insights to specific actions?

## Exercise 2: Insights Extraction Prompt Improvement

   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

2. Basic: "Tell me what's causing our customer churn."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

3. Basic: "What should we learn from our employee survey results?"
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

4. Basic: "Give me insights about our supply chain performance."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

5. Basic: "What does our product usage data tell us?"
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

## Exercise 3: Insight Framework Development

For each of the following business scenarios, develop a structured framework for extracting insights:

1. Understanding factors driving employee engagement and turnover

2. Identifying opportunities to optimize a digital customer acquisition funnel

3. Analyzing the effectiveness of a product feature release

4. Evaluating market entry potential for a new geographic region

5. Diagnosing issues in a manufacturing quality control process

For each framework, specify:
- The key categories of insights to extract
- How insights should be validated and prioritized
- How to structure the presentation of insights
- How to connect insights to specific actions

## Exercise 4: Multi-Perspective Insight Prompts

Create insight extraction prompts for the same dataset (quarterly financial results) from three different perspectives:

1. From a shareholder/investor perspective

2. From an operational efficiency perspective

3. From a strategic growth perspective

For each prompt, explain how you've tailored the insight requirements to address the specific concerns and priorities of that perspective.

## Exercise 5: Decision-Focused Insight Extraction

Select a business decision from the list below and craft a comprehensive insight extraction prompt specifically designed to inform that decision:

1. Whether to invest in expanding production capacity

2. How to optimize pricing strategy across product lines

3. Which customer segments to prioritize for retention efforts

4. Whether to enter a new market or product category

5. How to allocate marketing budget across channels

Your prompt should specify:
- The exact decision context and options being considered
- The types of insights needed to inform the decision
- How insights should be structured and prioritized
- How recommendations should be formulated
- How to address uncertainty and risk

## Exercise 6: Insight-to-Action Mapping

Develop a comprehensive prompt for extracting insights from customer feedback data that includes a detailed framework for mapping insights to specific actions. Your prompt should:

1. Define categories of insights to extract (e.g., product issues, service gaps, competitive factors)
2. Specify how insights should be validated and prioritized
3. Create a structured approach for translating each insight into:
   - Specific action steps
   - Required resources
   - Implementation timeline
   - Expected outcomes
   - Success metrics

Test your prompt by applying it to a hypothetical scenario where a company has received mixed feedback about a recent product launch. Outline how your prompt would guide the extraction of actionable insights from this feedback.
