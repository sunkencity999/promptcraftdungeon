# Data Exploration Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Data Exploration Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following data exploration prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Analyze this dataset."

2. "As a senior data scientist, perform exploratory data analysis on the attached customer churn dataset. Include summary statistics for all variables, distribution analysis with appropriate visualizations, correlation analysis between numerical features, and identification of potential outliers. Present findings in a structured report with clear sections and interpretations of what each finding might mean for churn prediction."

3. "Look at sales data and tell me what you find."

4. "As a retail analytics specialist, explore the provided e-commerce transaction dataset (2019-2021) containing customer purchases, browsing behavior, and demographic information. Analyze purchase patterns across different customer segments, identify seasonal trends in product categories, examine the relationship between browsing time and conversion rate, and flag any data quality issues that might affect interpretation. Present insights in a structured format with supporting statistical evidence and business implications."

5. "Find patterns in the marketing campaign results."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts have clear dataset specifications?
- Which prompts provide specific analytical direction?
- Which prompts include output format requirements?
- How would you improve the weaker prompts?

## Exercise 2: Dataset Specification Enhancement

Enhance the following basic data prompts by adding detailed dataset specifications:

1. "Analyze customer feedback data."
2. "Explore website traffic patterns."
3. "Examine employee performance metrics."
4. "Investigate product defect rates."
5. "Analyze financial transaction data."

**Example enhancement:**
- Basic: "Analyze sales data."
- Enhanced: "Analyze a retail sales dataset containing 3 years (2020-2022) of daily transactions from 50 store locations across 5 regions. The dataset includes transaction ID, timestamp, store ID, product category, product ID, quantity sold, unit price, total amount, payment method, and customer loyalty status. The data represents both in-store and online sales channels with approximately 2 million transaction records."

## Exercise 3: Analytical Direction Specification

For each of the following datasets, create a prompt that includes comprehensive analytical direction:

1. Healthcare patient readmission data
2. Social media engagement metrics
3. Manufacturing quality control measurements
4. Customer support ticket information
5. Supply chain logistics data

Your prompts should specify:
- Statistical methods to apply
- Key variables to focus on
- Relationships to investigate
- Distribution analyses to perform
- Temporal patterns to examine

## Exercise 4: Output Format and Presentation Requirements

Create data exploration prompts that include explicit output format and presentation requirements for each of the following scenarios:

1. A business executive needs to understand customer segmentation
2. A marketing team needs insights on campaign performance
3. A product development team needs user behavior analysis
4. A finance department needs expense pattern analysis
5. A operations team needs process efficiency insights

For each prompt, include requirements for:
- Structure and organization
- Visualization types
- Level of technical detail
- Interpretation guidelines
- Business implications focus

## Exercise 5: Data Quality Assessment Specifications

For each of the following data scenarios, create a prompt that thoroughly addresses data quality assessment:

1. A dataset with potential missing values and outliers
2. A merged dataset from multiple sources
3. A time series dataset with possible seasonality and trend breaks
4. A survey dataset with potential response biases
5. A large dataset with potential sampling issues

Your prompts should specify:
- Data completeness checks
- Consistency validations
- Outlier identification approaches
- Bias assessment methods
- Data limitation acknowledgments

## Challenge Exercise: Comprehensive Data Exploration Framework

Create a comprehensive data exploration prompt framework that can be adapted for different analytical contexts. Your framework should include sections for:

1. Dataset specification (type, domain, size, structure, source)
2. Analytical direction (methods, focus, relationships, distributions)
3. Quality assessment requirements (completeness, consistency, limitations)
4. Output format and presentation (structure, visualizations, interpretations)
5. Business context and implications
6. Next steps recommendations

Use your framework to create detailed prompts for:
1. Customer behavior analysis for an e-commerce platform
2. Operational efficiency analysis for a manufacturing process
3. Risk assessment for a financial services portfolio

For each prompt, explain how your framework ensures the exploration will be thorough, relevant, and actionable.
