# Data Visualization Prompt Engineering Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Visualization Prompt Analysis

Analyze the following data visualization prompts and identify which elements make them effective or ineffective:

1. "Create some charts for our sales data."

2. "As a data visualization specialist, design a sales performance dashboard for our executive team that includes: (1) a line chart showing monthly revenue trends with year-over-year comparison, (2) a bar chart comparing performance across product categories, (3) a map visualization highlighting regional performance, and (4) a KPI section with key metrics vs targets. Use our brand colors (blue #0033CC, gray #666666, accent green #00AA55), ensure all visualizations are colorblind-friendly, and include brief annotations highlighting key insights from each visualization."

3. "Make a pie chart of our customer segments."

4. "As a business intelligence analyst, create a visual narrative explaining the impact of our recent pricing strategy changes. Design a sequence of 5 visualizations that tell a cohesive story, starting with market context, showing the pricing changes implementation, and demonstrating results across different customer segments. For each visualization, include a clear headline stating the key insight, use appropriate chart types for the specific data relationships, and add annotations highlighting important patterns. Ensure visual consistency across the sequence and conclude with a summary visualization that reinforces the main business impact."

5. "Show me the website traffic data in a graph."

**Questions to consider:**
- Which prompts have clear visualization specifications?
- Which prompts provide specific design guidance?
- Which prompts include output format requirements?
- Which prompts consider the audience and purpose?

## Exercise 2: Visualization Prompt Improvement

Rewrite the following basic visualization prompts to make them more effective:

1. Basic: "Create a chart showing our customer satisfaction scores."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

2. Basic: "Make a dashboard about our marketing campaign performance."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

3. Basic: "Visualize the relationship between price and sales."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

4. Basic: "Show me how our different stores are performing."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

5. Basic: "Create a visualization of our customer journey data."
   
   Improved: [Write your improved prompt here]

## Exercise 3: Chart Type Selection

For each of the following data scenarios, specify the most appropriate chart type(s) and explain why:

1. Comparing sales performance across 15 different product categories

2. Showing the trend of website traffic over the past 12 months

3. Displaying the proportion of revenue from different customer segments

4. Visualizing the correlation between marketing spend and sales across 50 different campaigns

5. Showing the geographic distribution of customers across a country

6. Comparing actual performance against targets for 8 different KPIs

7. Visualizing the distribution of customer satisfaction scores (1-10 scale)

8. Showing the flow of users through a conversion funnel with 5 stages

## Exercise 4: Audience-Specific Visualization Prompts

Create visualization prompts for the same dataset (customer churn data) tailored to three different audiences:

1. For the executive team (strategic decision-makers)

2. For the customer service team (operational focus)

3. For the data science team (technical analysis)

For each prompt, explain how you've adapted the visualization requirements to meet the specific needs and technical literacy of the audience.

## Exercise 5: Multi-Chart Dashboard Design

Design a comprehensive prompt for a sales performance dashboard that includes at least 5 different visualization types. Your prompt should specify:

- The purpose and audience for the dashboard
- Each visualization type and what it should show
- How the visualizations should work together to tell a coherent story
- Design specifications (colors, layout, annotations)
- Any interactive elements or filters

## Exercise 6: Visualization Framework Development

Develop a reusable framework for data visualization prompts that could be applied across different business contexts. Your framework should include:

1. A template structure with placeholders for key elements
2. Guidance on how to adapt the framework for different data types
3. Options for different levels of technical complexity
4. Considerations for different output formats and platforms

Test your framework by applying it to three different business scenarios:

1. Financial performance visualization for investors
2. Customer behavior analysis for marketing
3. Operational efficiency visualization for manufacturing

For each scenario, explain how your framework ensures the visualizations will be effective, appropriate, and actionable.
