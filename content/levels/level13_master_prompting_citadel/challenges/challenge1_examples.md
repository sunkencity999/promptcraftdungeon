# Meta-Prompting Examples

## Basic Meta-Prompting Examples

### Example 1: Simple Prompt Creation Guide

**Prompt:**
```
As a writing instructor, create a guide for students on how to write effective essay prompts that include a clear topic, target audience, and purpose.
```

**Why it works:**
- Defines the role (writing instructor)
- Specifies the meta-task (create a guide for writing prompts)
- Identifies key elements to include (topic, audience, purpose)
- Targets a specific context (students writing essay prompts)

### Example 2: Structured Interview Question Framework

**Prompt:**
```

1. Target specific job competencies
2. Require candidates to describe past experiences
3. Follow the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
4. Avoid bias and leading questions

Include 2-3 example templates that hiring managers can customize for different roles.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specifies the role (HR specialist)
- Defines the meta-task (develop a framework for creating questions)
- Provides a structured format with numbered elements
- Requests specific components (STAR method, bias avoidance)
- Asks for customizable templates
