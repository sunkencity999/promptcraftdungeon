# Integrated Prompting Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Integrated Prompt Analysis

Below is an integrated prompt that combines multiple techniques. Analyze its structure and identify the different techniques being integrated:

```
As a Design Thinking Facilitator, create a comprehensive workshop plan for a product innovation session that combines:

1. Empathy mapping exercises to understand user needs and pain points
2. Systems thinking activities to map the broader context and interdependencies
3. Creative ideation techniques with specific constraints to guide innovative thinking
4. Rapid prototyping methods that balance fidelity with speed
5. Structured evaluation frameworks that consider feasibility, viability, and desirability

The workshop should progress through clear phases while allowing for iteration between activities. Include specific time allocations, materials needed, facilitation notes, and adaptation strategies for both in-person and virtual settings. Design the workshop to accommodate both technical and non-technical participants while ensuring all voices are heard.
```

**Questions to consider:**
1. What different prompt engineering techniques are being integrated?
2. How does the prompt balance structure with flexibility?
3. What dimensions of integration are present (methodological, audience, format, etc.)?
4. How does the prompt handle potential tensions between different elements?
5. How might you improve this integrated prompt?

## Exercise 2: Multi-Technique Integration

Create an integrated prompt that combines at least three of the following prompt engineering techniques:

1. Role-based prompting
2. Chain-of-thought reasoning
3. Few-shot examples
4. Structured formatting
5. Constraint specification
6. Evaluation criteria

Your integrated prompt should:
- Have a clear purpose and target domain
- Seamlessly blend the techniques rather than just sequencing them
- Include guidance on how the techniques should interact
- Balance different requirements and considerations
- Produce a coherent, unified output rather than disconnected components

Explain how your prompt achieves integration and why the specific techniques you chose work well together for your selected purpose.

## Exercise 3: Cross-Disciplinary Framework

Design an integrated prompt that creates a framework bridging two or more of the following disciplines:

1. Data science and storytelling
2. Psychology and product design
3. Environmental science and urban planning
4. Business strategy and ethical philosophy
5. Education and game design

Your integrated prompt should:
- Establish a clear purpose for the cross-disciplinary integration
- Identify key concepts, methods, or principles from each discipline
- Create meaningful connections between the disciplines
- Address potential tensions or contradictions between disciplinary approaches
- Provide a structured framework that practitioners from either discipline could use
- Include evaluation criteria for successful integration

Focus on creating genuine synthesis rather than simply applying concepts from one discipline to another.

## Exercise 4: Multi-Stakeholder Integration

Create an integrated prompt that addresses the needs and perspectives of multiple stakeholders in a complex decision-making scenario. Choose one of the following contexts:

1. Healthcare policy development
2. Corporate sustainability initiative
3. Educational curriculum redesign
4. Urban development project
5. Technology ethics framework

Your integrated prompt should:
- Identify the key stakeholder groups and their primary concerns
- Create a structured approach that balances different stakeholder perspectives
- Include mechanisms for addressing conflicting priorities
- Integrate different types of considerations (ethical, practical, financial, etc.)
- Provide a framework for reaching decisions that acknowledge trade-offs
- Include both process guidance and output structure

The goal is to create a prompt that leads to balanced, comprehensive approaches rather than solutions that overemphasize one stakeholder perspective.

## Exercise 5: Temporal Integration Design

Create an integrated prompt that works across different time horizons, connecting immediate actions with long-term outcomes. Choose a domain where this temporal integration is particularly important (e.g., climate action, career development, organizational change, technology roadmapping).

Your integrated prompt should:
- Define at least three different time horizons (e.g., immediate, medium-term, long-term)
- Create a framework that connects actions across these time horizons
- Include methods for balancing urgent needs with long-term considerations
- Provide approaches for managing uncertainty that increases with time horizon
- Integrate different types of thinking appropriate to different time scales
- Include feedback mechanisms between time horizons

Focus on creating genuine integration across time rather than simply sequencing separate plans for different time periods.

## Challenge Exercise: Meta-Integrated Prompt System

Design a meta-integrated prompt system: a prompt that guides the creation of effective integrated prompts for different contexts and purposes. This higher-order prompt should provide a framework for developing prompts that successfully integrate multiple techniques, perspectives, and dimensions.

Your meta-integrated prompt system should include:
- A methodology for selecting which elements to integrate based on purpose
- Principles for effective integration across different dimensions
- Strategies for resolving tensions between integrated elements
- Quality criteria for evaluating integrated prompts
- A structured process for developing, testing, and refining integrated prompts
- Examples of successful integration patterns for different contexts

This exercise challenges you to think about integrated prompting at a meta-level, developing a systematic approach to creating prompts that effectively combine multiple techniques and perspectives.
