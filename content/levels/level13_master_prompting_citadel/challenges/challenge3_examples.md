## Basic Integrated Prompting Examples

### Example 1: Simple Multi-Technique Integration

**Prompt:**
```
As a UX researcher, create a user interview protocol for evaluating a new mobile banking app that combines:

1. Role-based scenarios: Include 3 specific user scenarios representing different banking needs (e.g., checking balances, transferring funds, paying bills)

2. Comparative evaluation: For each scenario, ask users to compare this app with their current banking method

3. Think-aloud protocol: Guide users to verbalize their thoughts while completing each task

4. Satisfaction scale: After each scenario, include a 1-5 rating scale for different aspects (ease of use, visual clarity, speed, trust)

5. Open reflection: Conclude with open-ended questions about overall impressions and improvement suggestions

The protocol should flow naturally while systematically gathering both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics.
```

**Why it works:**

```

**Problems:**
- No specified role
- Extremely vague integration goal ("combines different approaches")
- No specific problem domain or context
- No guidance on which approaches to integrate
- No indication of how integration should occur
- No purpose or application specified

### Improved Prompt:
```
As a business innovation strategist, create an integrated problem-solving framework for product development teams that combines:
