# Adaptive Prompting Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Adaptive Response Analysis

Below is an example of an adaptive prompt with a user response. Analyze how the prompt should adapt based on the response:

**Initial Prompt:**
```
I'd like to help you improve your writing skills. Could you share a short paragraph you've written recently that you'd like feedback on?
```

**User Response:**
```
I don't have a specific paragraph, but I struggle with writing conclusions for academic papers. I never know how to wrap things up without just repeating what I already said.
```

**Questions to consider:**
1. How should the prompt adapt based on this response?
2. What specific elements in the user's response indicate the need for adaptation?
3. What would be an effective follow-up prompt?
4. What assumptions should be avoided in the adaptation?
5. How might you design the next interaction to gather more specific information?

## Exercise 2: Multi-Path Conversation Design

Design a multi-path conversation starter for a customer support scenario with at least three different adaptation paths. Your prompt should:

1. Begin with an initial question to the customer
2. Include specific adaptation paths based on different possible responses
3. For each path, provide follow-up questions that are tailored to that specific scenario
4. Include guidance on tone and approach adjustments for each path
5. Specify how to recognize when to switch between paths if the conversation evolves

Focus on a specific product or service (e.g., software troubleshooting, return process, subscription management) and design the conversation to efficiently address customer needs while adapting to their specific situation.

## Exercise 3: Depth Calibration Design

Create an adaptive prompt for an educational context that can adjust its depth based on the learner's response. Your prompt should:

1. Start with an initial question about a concept (choose a topic you're familiar with)
2. Include adaptation strategies for three different knowledge levels:
   - Novice (little to no prior knowledge)
   - Intermediate (basic understanding but some gaps)
   - Advanced (solid understanding seeking deeper insights)
3. For each knowledge level, specify:
   - How to recognize this level from the response
   - How to adjust explanation complexity and terminology
   - What examples or analogies to use
   - What follow-up questions to ask
4. Include a strategy for recalibrating if you've misjudged the knowledge level

Your adaptive educational prompt should help learners engage with the material at an appropriate level while encouraging them to deepen their understanding.

## Exercise 4: Emotional Adaptation Framework

Design an adaptive prompting framework for a scenario where emotional states significantly impact the interaction. Choose one of the following contexts:

1. Career coaching for someone considering a major change
2. Wellness coaching for establishing new health habits
3. Financial advising for someone dealing with debt
4. Creative feedback for an artist or writer sharing their work

Your framework should include:
- An initial prompt that opens the conversation
- Guidance for recognizing different emotional states from responses (e.g., anxiety, enthusiasm, defensiveness, confusion)
- Specific adaptation strategies for at least four different emotional states
- Approaches for transitioning between emotional support and practical guidance
- Methods for checking in and recalibrating the emotional read throughout the conversation

Focus on creating a framework that responds empathetically while still moving toward constructive outcomes.

## Exercise 5: Progressive Disclosure Strategy

Design an adaptive prompt that implements progressive disclosure for explaining a complex topic. Choose a topic that naturally has multiple layers of complexity (e.g., a scientific concept, technical process, or abstract theory).

Your adaptive prompt should:
1. Start with a simple, accessible explanation
2. Include specific triggers in user responses that would indicate:
   - Confusion requiring simplification
   - Understanding ready for more depth
   - Interest in specific aspects requiring elaboration
   - Misconceptions needing correction
3. Provide at least three levels of progressive detail
4. Include strategies for checking understanding before increasing complexity
5. Incorporate methods for backtracking to simpler explanations if needed

The goal is to create a conversation that dynamically adjusts to the user's comprehension level, gradually building understanding without overwhelming them.

## Challenge Exercise: Comprehensive Adaptive System

Design a comprehensive adaptive prompting system for conducting user research interviews. Your system should:

1. Include an initial prompt that establishes rapport and sets expectations
2. Provide a framework for assessing user characteristics from early responses:
   - Technical sophistication
   - Communication style
   - Level of engagement
   - Areas of interest/concern
3. Design adaptation strategies for:
   - Question complexity and terminology
   - Follow-up depth based on answer quality
   - Exploration of unexpected topics that emerge
   - Handling resistance or brief responses
4. Create recovery strategies for conversation breakdowns
5. Include transition approaches between different interview sections
6. Provide methods for summarizing and validating understanding throughout

Your system should balance structure with flexibility, allowing the interview to follow the user's lead while still gathering the necessary information. Include specific example prompts for key points in the conversation flow and decision criteria for major adaptation points.
