## What is PromptCraft Dungeon?

PromptCraft Dungeon is a text-based adventure game inspired by classic dungeon crawlers, but with a modern twist: **you progress by learning and applying effective prompt engineering techniques.** Instead of just typing "open door", you'll learn to craft specific, clear, and structured prompts to interact with the game world, solve puzzles, and overcome challenges presented by a simulated AI-like environment.

## Purpose

The primary goal of PromptCraft Dungeon is to **gamify the process of learning prompt engineering**. It aims to take players from novice prompt users to skilled practitioners by providing:

* An engaging, adventurous context for learning.
* Progressive difficulty, introducing concepts step-by-step.
* Direct feedback on the effectiveness of player prompts.
* Practical application of techniques like specificity, iteration, persona, formatting, constraints, and evaluation.
* Comprehensive educational content with theory, examples, and practice exercises for each concept.

## Features

* **Classic Text Adventure Feel:** Retro terminal aesthetic with scrolling text.
* **Educational Focus:** Designed to teach prompt engineering skills through interactive challenges.
* **Multiple Levels:** Explore 13 unique themed areas, each teaching different prompt engineering concepts:
  * Level 1: Hall of First Words - Basic Action-Target structure
  * Level 2: Echoing Caverns - Specificity in prompts
  * Level 3: Parameter Chambers - Adding necessary parameters
  * Level 4: Persona Nexus - Persona-based prompting
  * Level 5: Constraint Core - Negative constraints
  * Level 6: Framework Observatory - Structured frameworks
  * Level 7: Creative Writing Realm - Narrative prompt engineering
  * Level 8: Code Forge - Code generation prompting
  * Level 9: Data Analysis Nexus - Data exploration prompting
  * Level 10: HR Management Suite - Recruitment prompting
  * Level 11: Sysadmin Command Center - Troubleshooting prompting
  * Level 12: Research Laboratory - Literature review prompting
  * Level 13: Master Prompting Citadel - Advanced integrated techniques
* **Comprehensive Educational Content:** Each level includes:
  * **Theory:** Detailed explanations of prompt engineering concepts
  * **Examples:** Practical examples showing concepts in action
  * **Practice Exercises:** Interactive exercises to reinforce learning
* **Prompt-Based Puzzles:** Interact with the world, solve puzzles, and unlock paths by crafting effective prompts.
* **NPC Interaction:** Encounter characters who provide hints, lore, and specific challenges.
* **Targeted Feedback:** Receive guidance when prompts are unclear, too vague, or ineffective, helping you learn *why* they didn't work.
* **Progression System:** Gain Experience Points (XP), level up, and unlock conceptual abilities/knowledge.
* **Save/Load System:** Automatically saves progress in your browser's `localStorage`. Automatically loads your last saved state when you reopen the game.
* **Reset Option:** Allows you to clear saved progress and start over.
* **Certificate of Completion:** Earn a certificate upon completing all levels and mastering prompt engineering skills.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Download Files:** Make sure you have the following files in the **same folder**:
   * `index.html`
   * `style.css`
   * `script.js`
2. **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Double-clicking the file should usually work.

## How to Play

1. **Read:** Pay close attention to the descriptions of your location, objects, NPCs, and any specific tasks presented.
2. **Prompt:** Type your commands (prompts) into the input field at the bottom (where the `>` indicator is).
3. **Enter:** Press the `Enter` key to submit your command.
4. **Observe:** Read the game's response. Did it work? Did you get feedback?
5. **Refine:** Based on the response, adjust your next prompt to be more specific, clear, or structured as needed.
6. **Basic Commands:**
   * `look` or `look around`: Re-displays the description of your current area.
   * `help` or `commands`: Shows a list of available system commands (like `hint`, `analyze`, `reset`).
   * `hint`: Provides a hint for the current challenge (if available and unlocked).
   * `analyze`: After a failed command, provides detailed feedback on why it might have failed (if unlocked).
   * `ask [NPC name] about [topic]`: Interact with characters (e.g., `ask guide about crystals`).
   * `greet [NPC name]`: Greet a character.

## Maximizing Your Learning Experience

To get the most out of PromptCraft Dungeon and truly master prompt engineering skills, follow these best practices:

1. **Explore Educational Content Before Attempting Challenges:**
   * **Read the Theory:** Before attempting each level's challenges, click the "Learn" button to access educational content. Start with the Theory tab to understand the prompt engineering concepts being taught.
   * **Study the Examples:** After reading the theory, review the Examples tab to see practical applications of the concepts.
   * **Practice with Exercises:** Complete the Practice exercises to reinforce your understanding before tackling the actual game challenges.

2. **Progressive Skill Building:**
   * Complete all challenges in each level before moving to the next.
   * Each level builds upon skills taught in previous levels.
   * If you're struggling with a challenge, revisit the educational content for that level.

3. **Reflect on Feedback:**
   * When a prompt fails, use the `analyze` command to understand why.
   * Pay attention to the specific feedback provided by NPCs and the game system.
   * Use this feedback to refine your approach to prompt engineering.

4. **Apply Multiple Techniques:**
   * As you progress through the game, combine techniques from different levels.
   * The most advanced challenges will require integrating multiple prompt engineering skills.

5. **Review and Practice:**
   * Periodically revisit earlier levels to reinforce fundamental concepts.
   * Use the practice exercises to hone specific skills that need improvement.
   * Try alternative approaches to challenges you've already completed to deepen your understanding.

## Save, Load, and Reset

* **Automatic Save:** The game automatically saves your progress to your browser's `localStorage` *after* you successfully complete a challenge or load into a new level.
* **Automatic Load:** When you open `index.html`, the game will automatically check for saved data and load it if found, allowing you to continue where you left off.
* **Resetting Progress:** If you want to start completely fresh, type `reset` and press Enter. The game will ask for confirmation. Type `confirm reset` and press Enter to permanently delete your saved progress for this browser. The page will then reload, showing the initial start screen.
